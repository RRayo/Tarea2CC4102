          INT. KITCHENS, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Our Maid dives into the bustle of Wayne Manor below stairs -
          Caterers and Maids, Wait Staff. She overhears another Maid.

                          MAID 2
           They say he never leaves the East
           Wing.

                          MAID 3
           I heard he had an accident - that
           he's disfigured.

                         
          The other Maids signal her to be quiet. All the chatter has
          died. Alfred has entered the kitchen.

                          ALFRED
           Mr. Till, why are your people using
           the main stairs?
          Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered
          plate. Picks up the tray, looks around the chaotic kitchen.

                         

                          ALFRED
           Where's Mrs. Bolton?

                          MAID
           She's up at the bar, sir. Can I
           help?

                         
          Alfred looks at the Maid. Hands her a key and the tray.

                          ALFRED
           The East drawing room. Unlock the
           door, place the tray on the table,
           lock the door again. Nothing more.

           12.

                         

                         
          The Maid nods. Takes the tray.

                         

          INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Following the Maid through the empty house. She comes to the
          large oak door to the East Wing. Unlocks it...

                         

          INT. DRAWING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

          The room is dark, quiet. The Maid places the tray on the
          table. She looks at the inner door opposite. It is ajar...

                         

          INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Alfred talks to an elegant woman, thirties, Miranda Tate.

                          ALFRED
           I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've
           tried. He won't see you.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           It's important, Mr. Pennyworth.
          Her accent is European. Hard to place.

                          ALFRED
           Mr. Wayne is as determined to
           ignore important things as trivial
           ones.

           MALE VOICE (O.S.)
           Don't take it personally, Miranda.

                         
          They turn to see a man in his fifties. Daggett.

                          DAGGETT
           Everyone knows Wayne's holed up in
           there with eight-inch nails, peeing
           into Mason jars. (To Alfred.) Good
           of you to let me on the grounds.

                          ALFRED
           The Dent Act is about all Gotham.
           Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate,
           always a pleasure.
          Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib.

           13.

                         

                         

                          DAGGETT
           Why waste your time talking to the
           man who threw away your investment
           on some save-the-world vanity
           project? He can't help you get your
           money back. But I can.

                          MIRANDA
           I could try explaining that a
           save-the-world project, vain or
           not, is worth investing in,
           whatever the return. I could try,
           Mr. Daggett, but you understand
           only money and the power you think
           it buys, so why waste my time,
           indeed?

                         
          She walks away. Daggett watches her go.

                         

          INT. DRAWING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

          Close on the dinner tray. We hear a labored step approach.
          Bruce Wayne appears, leaning on a cane. Gaunt. Grey temples.
          He lifts the lid of his dinner, then freezes, hearing
          something. He slowly limps into the next room...

                         

          INT. SITTING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR, CONTINUOUS


                         
          The Maid looks at framed photographs of Rachel, Thomas and
          Martha Wayne. Some are half-burned. She notices an archery
          target, arrows stuck in it. She reaches out. WHAM! An arrow
          sticks into the target - the Maid spins around, flustered.
          Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite
          bow. Picks up his cane.

                          MAID
           I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.
           It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

                         
          Wayne nods, gently. Limps towards her.

                          MAID
           Although you don't have the long
           nails... (Nervous laugh.) Or facial
           scars...
          She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. She seems very young.

                          WAYNE
           Is that what they say about me?

           14.

                         

                          MAID
           It's just that...nobody sees you...

                         
          Wayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace.

                          WAYNE
           That's a beautiful necklace.
           Reminds me of the one that belonged
           to my mother. It can't be the same
           one - her pearls are in this safe -
          He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the
          bureau, revealing a safe door...
           - which the manufacturer clearly
           explained is uncrackable.

                         
          ...which swings open with an awkward creak.

                          MAID
           Oops. No one told me it was
           uncrackable.

                         
          The Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older.

                          WAYNE
           I'm afraid I can't let you take
           those.

                         
          She smiles at him. Moves towards him.

                          MAID
           Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any
           more than I would beat up a
           cripple.
          She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down.
           Of course, sometimes exceptions
           have to be made.

                         
          The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window.
           Goodnight, Mr. Wayne.
          She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then
          rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace.
          He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder...

                         

          EXT. DRIVE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

          Moving toward the line of town cars, the Maid pulls off her
          white apron, cuffs and collar, leaving a black dress and
          pearls. A Valet hurries to open a car door for her - she
          slips into a town car...beside the Congressman.

           15.

                         

                         

                          MAID
           Can I have a ride?
          The Congressman, a little tipsy, looks at her hungrily.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           You read my mind.

                         

          INT. EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - LATER


                         
          Alfred enters, to find Wayne kneeling at the safe.

                          ALFRED
           Miss Tate was asking to see you
           again.

                         

                          WAYNE
           She's very persistent.

                          ALFRED
           And quite lovely, in case you were
           wondering.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I wasn't.

                          ALFRED
           What are you doing?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Examining print dust. We've been
           robbed.

                          ALFRED
           And this is your idea of raising
           the alarm?

                          WAYNE

                          (SHRUGS)
           She took the pearls. Tracking
           device and all.

                          ALFRED
           She?

                         

                          WAYNE
           One of the maids, perhaps you
           should stop letting them in this
           side of the house.

           16.

                         

                         

                          ALFRED
           Perhaps you should learn to make
           your own bed, then. Why are you
           dusting for prints?

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm not. She was.

                         

          EXT. ROOFTOP, MAJOR CRIMES UNIT - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon brings a stack of files against the air duct, settles
          to read. Next to him is a rusty, broken searchlight.

           YOUNG VOICE (O.S.)
           Sir?

                         
          A young Cop is standing there. This is Blake.

                          BLAKE
           I didn't want to bother you up
           here, but they're looking for you.

                         

                          GORDON
           What's the problem, son?

                          BLAKE
           Congressman Gilly's wife's been
           calling. He hasn't made it home
           from the Wayne Foundation event.

                          GORDON
           That's a job for the police?

                          BLAKE
           Sir, I've been a cop for a year and
           I've only logged half a dozen
           arrests. When you and Dent cleaned
           the streets you cleaned 'em good.
           Pretty soon we'll be chasing
           overdue library books.
          Gordon smiles at this. Blake looks at his stack of files.

                          BLAKE
           But here you are. Like we're still
           at war...

                          GORDON
           Old habits.

                          BLAKE
           Or instinct.

                          GORDON
           What's your name, son?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Blake, sir.

                          GORDON
           You have something you want to ask
           me, Officer Blake?

                          BLAKE
           It's that night. This night, eight
           years ago. The night Dent died.

                         

                          GORDON
           What about it?

                          BLAKE
           The last confirmed sighting of the
           Batman. He murders those people,
           takes out two SWAT teams, breaks
           Dent's neck...then just vanishes?

                          GORDON
           I'm not hearing a question, son.

                         
          Blake shifts uneasily. Then looks at Gordon.

                          BLAKE
           Don't you want to know who we was?
          Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes
          his fingers across its rusted shell.

                          GORDON
           I know exactly who he was. (Turns
           to Blake.) He was Batman.

                         
          Gordon walks past Blake, heading for the stairs.

           GORDON (O.S.)
           Let's go see about the
           Congressman's wife...

          Alfred takes his tray into the bedroom. The bed is empty.

          Alfred hits three notes on the piano. The bookcase opens.

          Alfred walks through the arches as the stone floor starts to
          lower, becoming a ramp. At the bottom, Alfred is level with
          a series of dark slate obelisks - a bridge over the water to
          where Wayne sits at a computer atop a massive slate cube.

                         

                          ALFRED

           Just trying to find out more about
           our jewel thief. I ran her prints
           from the photos she handled -
          Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery
          suspect.
           - but she was wearing someone
           else's fingerprints. She's good.

                          ALFRED
           She may be. But we have the trace
           on the necklace.

                         

                          WAYNE
           We do, so I cross-referenced the
           address she went back to with
           police data on high-end

          Wayne hits a key. A photograph of the Maid appears.
           Selina Kyle. The databases are full
           of close calls, tips from fences...

          Newspaper headlines appear -

           We should send the police before
           she fences the pearls.

                          WAYNE
           She won't. She likes them too much.
           And they weren't what she was
           after.

                          ALFRED
           What was she after?

                         

                          WAYNE
           My fingerprints. There was printer
           toner mixed with graphite on the
           safe. Gives you a good pull, and
           it's untraceable.

                         

                          ALFRED
           Fascinating. Maybe you should
           exchange notes over coffee.

                          WAYNE
           Now you're trying to set me up with
           a jewel thief?

                          ALFRED
           At this point, sir, I would set you
           up with a chimpanzee if I thought
           it would bring you back into the
           world.

                          WAYNE
           There's nothing out there for me.

                         

                          ALFRED
           And that's the problem. You hung up
           the cape and cowl, but never moved
           on. You won't get out there and
           find a life. Find someone -

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (BITTER)
           I did find someone, Alfred.

           20.

                         

                         

                          ALFRED
           I know. And then you lost them.
           That's part of living, sir. But
           you're not living - you're waiting.
           Hoping for things to go bad again.

                         
          Wayne says nothing.
           Remember when you left Gotham?
           Before all this. Before Batman.
           Seven years you were gone. Seven
           years I waited. Hoping that you
           wouldn't come back.
          Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding.
           Every year I took my holiday. I'd
           go to Florence. There's a café by
           the Arno... Any fine evening I
           would sit there and order a Fernet
           Branca...
          INSERT CUT: Alfred seated in a café sipping his drink...
           I had a fantasy. I liked to imagine
           that one day I'd look across the
           tables, and see you. Sitting there
           with your wife. Perhaps some kids.
           You wouldn't say anything to me, or
           me to you, but we'd both
           know...that you'd made it. That you
           were happy.

                         
          INSERT CUT: Alfred spots a couple at another table and looks
          closer, hopeful. But they are strangers.
           I never wanted you to come back to
           Gotham. I knew there was nothing
           there for you but pain and tragedy,
           and I wanted more for you than
           that. I still do.
          Alfred leaves Wayne to his cave. His bats.

                         

                         

          EXT. WATER TREATMENT FACILITY - DAY

          Blake and his partner, Ross, get out of their patrol car. A
          DWP Man leads them down a long concrete trough.

                         

                          DWP MAN
           They wash up a couple times a
           month. More when in gets colder -
           homeless sheltering in the tunnels.
           We had to pull him to clear the
           basin, but other than that we
           didn't touch him...

           21.

                         

                         
          They come out by the catchment basin. Above the grille lies
          a body - a teenage boy. Blake looks down at him. Freezes.

                          ROSS
           What?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Name's Jimmy. He's at St.
           Swithin's. (Off look.) The boys
           home where I...I coach some ball.

                         

                         

          EXT. ST. SWITHIN'S HOME FOR BOYS - DAY

          Blake looks up at the shabby building.
