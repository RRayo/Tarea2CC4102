	1.  EXT. NIGHT. - THE PACIFIC IS ANYTHING BUT
	
	WINDS HOWL. Rain drives horizontal. The sea surges up, 
	nearly to the flight deck of the Aircraft Carrier USS Kitty 
	Hawk. The carrier plunges, driving its bow into a wall of 
	grey water. The deck pitches forward and back, rolls left to 
	right, and yaws in a corkscrew motion. The entire 93,000 ton 
	behemoth rises and falls in the TYPHOON-DRIVEN SWELL. 
	
	
	2.  SOMETHING DROPS DOWN OUT OF THE NIGHT
	
	A ROAR. Silver wings flash by, a cockpit, fiery jet 
	exhausts. A forty ton monster drops at 120 knots into an area 
	the size of a tennis court in a CONTROLLED CRASH. 
	
	2A.  A SHOWER OF SPARKS, A SCREECH OF RUBBER AND METAL as 
	the gear hits the deck. The hook catches the 3 wire and the 
	F-14 TOMCAT is slammed to a halt. It's the scariest thing 
	you've ever seen, the most dangerous maneuver in aviation and 
	just another day at the office for a Naval Aviator.
	
	TITLES OVER 
	
	HARD DRIVING ROCK AND ROLL - THE CARS - RIDE ME HIGH
	
	
	3.  FLIGHT DECK - THE LANDING SIGNAL OFFICER - (LSO)
	
	Leans almost horizontal into the winds. He holds the pickle, 
	controlling the landing lights and speaks into a mike. His 
	calm, professional commands belie the extreme conditions.
	
			LSO
	POWER, POWER...DON'T CLIMB...
	OKAY, HOLD WHAT YOU GOT.
	
	
	4.  ANOTHER TOMCAT FLIES OVER THE RAMP
	
	It slams in. The pilot hits full power, catches the wire, slams 
	to a stop, cuts his engines.
	
	5.  OMITTED
	
	6.  AIR OPS - BELOW DECK 
	
	Lots of scopes and electronic gear. The CARRIER CONTROL APPROACH 
	OFFICER (CCA) watches a blip on radar, reaches for his mike key.
	
	
	
	7.  EXT. THE TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING - (AERIAL)
	
	We float like gods, above the storm, above the cloud cover, 
	looking down. From overhead, a probe slides into frame, then 
	a graceful nose. The cockpit sides by, Pilot, then Radar 
	Intercept Officer (RIO) barely illuminated by the orange glow 
	of their instruments. The fuselage gracefully swells to two 
	enormous air intakes, then variable angle wings, swept back 
	for high speed flight. Twin tailbooms cant outward, 
	horizontal stabilizers make constant adjustments. Enormous 
	twin jet exhaust ports glow red in the moonlight.
	
	
	8.  INT. COCKPIT - (AERIAL)
	
	We become aware of WIND WHISTLE, JET ENGINE SOUNDS, RADIO 
	STATIC. The pilot, COUGAR, is calm, steady. The Radar 
	Intercept Officer in the backseat, GOOSE, is a wildman, 
	always an edge of humor in his voice. A UHF transmission 
	breaks in..
	
			STRIKE (V.O. filtered)
	GHOST RIDER, THIS IS STRIKE... WE 
	HAVE UNKNOWN CONTACT INBOUND, 
	MUSTANG. YOUR VECTOR ZERO NINE ZERO 
	FOR BOGEY.
	
	Almost immediately the RIO picks up a target and responds.
	
			GOOSE
	CONTACT 20 LEFT AT 25, 900 KNOTS 
	CLOSURE.
	
	
	8A.  ANGLE - SECOND F-14 - 115 - COUGAR'S WINGMAN 
	
	Come in on the cockpit with stenciled name and call signs: LT. 
	EVAN MITCHELL is the pilot, MAVERICK. In flight suit and oxygen 
	mask, we can only see his eyes. they are confident. In his 
	mid-twenties, he is lean, hard, athletic...the archetype fighter 
	pilot. His rear-seater is LTJG. WALTER MERLIN; WIZARD.
	
			MAVERICK
	I'LL I.D. HIM, YOU HOOK 'EM.
	
	Maverick peels off to right, to high cover position; 5 o'clock.
	
	
	9.  INT. GHOST RIDER 117 - COUGAR'S POV
	
	HEADS UP DISPLAY (HUD) glows dimly on the windscreen. Directly 
	in front of the stick, two CRT screens display data. The bottom 
	screen shows a radar sweep. Wedged between the instruments is a 
	snapshot of a pretty young woman with a 2 month-old baby.
	
	
			GOOSE
	Closing fast. MUSTANG, THIS IS 
	GHOST RIDER ONE ONE SEVEN. CONTACT 
	ONE BOGEY, 090 AT 15 MILES, 900 
	KNOTS OF CLOSURE.
			COUGAR
	Look for the trailer.
	
			GOOSE
	I don't see anything.  MAVERICK, 
	YOU HAVE A TRAILER?
	
	
	10.  MAVERICK'S F-14 
	
	Flying in combat spread, 1 mile abeam, higher. 
	
			GOOSE
	NEGATIVE, COUGAR. LOOKS LIKE HE'S 
	SINGLE.
	
	
	11.  INT. 117 - COUGAR'S COCKPIT
	
			COUGAR
	HANG BACK AND WATCH FOR HIM. HERE 
	COMES...MIG ONE.
	
	
	12.  EXT. SKY 
	
	Closing at 900 knots, The MiG is a speck, then a flash and a 
	ROAR, a knife-edge pass at 300 feet. It rockets past his left 
	wing tip and disappears. Cougar kicks rudder, whips the stick, 
	screams into a tight turning roll and dives after him. He slams 
	the throttle forward to ZONE 5 AFTERBURNER.  
	
	
	13.  EXT. - MAVERICK'S F-14
	
	Maverick sees a SECOND MiG drop from above onto Cougar's tail.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	BOGEY ON YOUR SIX. I'M ON HIS.
	
	Maverick swings after him, lights it. 
	
	
	13A.  ALL FOUR JETS SCREAM DOWN IN A POWER DIVE. 
	
	They punch through cloud cover into the soup.
	
	
	
	14.  EXT. COUGAR'S F-14 
	
	He is closing on the first MiG when a shocking BLIPBLIPBLIPBLIP 
	tone breaks into their headsets.
	
			GOOSE
	I've got a six strobe.  I think 
	he's locked on us.
	
			COUGAR
	It's a MiG 21. They don't have 
	radar missiles!
	
			GOOSE
	Let's hope you're right!
	
			COUGAR
	What is he doing?
	
			GOOSE
	He's pissing me off!
	
	Cougar swings mad gyrations, cutting back and forth across the 
	front MiG's tailpipe, trying to break the lock-on. The TONE grows 
	more insistant.
	
			COUGAR
	Can't shake him.
	
			MAVERICK (V.O.) 
	WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
	
			COUGAR
	Maintaining course. Straight for 
	Mustang.
	
			GOOSE
	Stay with him.
	
	The tone grows steady, BLIPBLIPBLIPBLIP.
	
			GOOSE
	   (alarmed)
	That's missile lock! 
	
			COUGAR
	He better be kidding!
	
			GOOSE
	Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole.
	Hope nobody burps!
	
	
	
	14A.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14
	
			MAVERICK
	I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR. (to himself)  
	Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
	
			COUGAR
	I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
	
			MAVERICK
	ROGER, COUGAR. (to himself and his RIO) 
	Okay boys, pull out with your hands up 
	and nobody'll get hurt.
	
	
	14B.  INT. COUGAR'S F-14
	
	Up front, Cougar checks his gunsight...He gets I.R. lock...
	
			COUGAR
	We're locked on MiG ONE. Why 
	doesn't he disengage?
	
			GOOSE
	These guys are getting on my 
	nerves.
	
	
	14C.   FINALLY, MIG ONE TURNS AWAY.
	
			GOOSE
	GHOST RIDER TO MUSTANG. BANDITS  
	TURNING AWAY.
	
	But Cougar presses forward, and MiG TWO stays on his tail.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	COUGAR, BREAK LEFT. TRY A HIGH G 
	ROLL UNDERNEATH. BREAK OUT THE 
	BOTTOM.
	
	Anger gives way to discipline. Cougar's Tomcat breaks left, 
	dives into dense cloud. MiG TWO still follows.
	
			MAVERICK
	HE'S STILL ON YOU, COUGAR.
	
	
	15.  EXT. COUGAR - IN THE CLOUDS
	
	Still hears the tone, BLIPBLIPBLIP...
	
			COUGAR
	
	I KNOW. I KNOW.
	
	He rolls over into wild evasive maneuvers, finally breaks lock. 
	
	
	16.  INT. MIG
	
	Breaks out of cloud, looks around, startled.  There is nothing, 
	no F-14. He scans the sky frantically, while rolling the 
	aircraft. ...Suddenly, he feels a presence. He looks straight up 
	and behind him. A few feet away, a TOMCAT slides into position 
	canopy to canopy, an incredible feat of flying. Maverick and 
	Wizard stare at him. Maverick slides even closer, canopies nearly 
	touching. The MiG pilot acknowledges them with a weak wave.  
	Maverick stares for a moment, then flips him the bird. 
	
	The MiG pushes negative G, hard down and away. He heads for the 
	deck.
	
			WIZARD
	He's running for it.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Ah, the thrill of victory and the 
	agony of defeat.
	
			WIZARD
	Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 
	4.0.  We're gonna get them wet 
	unless we find a Sonoco station.
	
			MAVERICK
	COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK.  I'M 
	GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE 
	BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU?
	
	
	17.  EXT. KITTY HAWK FLIGHT DECK - THE LSO 
	
	Stands the on plunging deck, peering into the roaring night.

	18.  INT. COCKPIT 117 - COUGAR
	
			COUGAR
	
	This is crazy. How the hell we 
	supposed to land on something we 
	can't even see!
	
			GOOSE
	Hey, if it was easy, everybody 
	would want to come up here and do 
	it..... Instead of just us.

	20.  INT. COCKPIT 117 - COUGAR'S POV
	
	
	BLASTS slam the airframe. Rain tattoos the canopy. A gust rolls 
	the Tomcat, he straightens it, A gust flips it again.
	
	
	20A.  MAVERICK'S POV 
	
	The Carrier lights appear and disappear through the storm.
	
	
	21.  INT. COCKPIT 117 - COUGAR
	
	 	 	GOOSE
	   (To Himself)
	
	A walk in the park, Mustang. You 
	with me, cat man?...Cougar...you 
	with me?
	
	Goose is thrown about as the wing dips, straightens, dips.
	
			COUGAR
	Help me with this one, I'm really 
	screwed up.
	
			GOOSE
	Bring it left. Bring it left, 
	You're high.
	
			COUGAR
	This is crazy!
	
			GOOSE
	What is?
	
			COUGAR
	Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
	
			GOOSE
	What?  What is it?
	
			COUGAR
	Were upside down!
	
			GOOSE
	You're crazy. We're level.
	
			COUGAR
	Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in 
	my straps!
	
			GOOSE
	You're not. We're level. Look at 
	the instruments, we're okay!
	
			COUGAR
	They must be broken. I'm hanging in 
	my straps! We're inverted!
	
			GOOSE
	We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
	
	
	22.  FLIGHT DECK - LSO CONTROLLING 115 - MAVERICK
	
			LSO
	A LITTLE POWER...FLY THE BALL.    
	LOOKING GOOD...HOLD WHAT YOU GOT.
	
	
	
	23.  MAVERICK'S F-14 - ON FINAL APPROACH.
	
	
	24.  INT. COCKPIT - MAVERICK
	
	He hears Cougar's chatter over the air.
	
			COUGAR (V.O. filtered)
	WE'RE UPSIDE DOWN! WE CAN'T LAND!
	
			GOOSE (V.O. filtered)
	WELL, WE CAN'T STAY UP HERE EITHER.
	
	
	25.  FLIGHT DECK 
	
	Maverick's plane settles in over the ramp, suddenly, BLASTS FROM 
	IT'S AFTERBURNERS...it ROARS over the deck without touching and 
	off into the night. The LSO is shocked into comment.
	
	
			LSO
	WHERE THE HELL YOU GOING?
	
	
	26.  MAVERICK'S COCKPIT  - (AERIAL)
	
			MAVERICK
	I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
	
			WIZARD
	What the hell you doing?
	
			MAVERICK
	Helping him in.
	
			WIZARD
	What makes you think we can get 
	back in?  We don't have the fuel 
	for this.
			MAVERICK
	Just get me to him.
	
			WIZARD
	He's nine o'clock high. We're two 
	thousand pounds low!
	
	
	27.  DARK TURBULENT CLOUDS
	
	Maverick's plane pulls up behind Cougar's. Cougar's plane 
	suddenly flips over, flying inverted.
	
	
			COUGAR
	I'm pulling up.
	
			GOOSE
	No! Now we're inverted!
	
	
	Maverick pulls up off the wing of the inverted aircraft. His 
	voice is calmness itself.
	
			MAVERICK
	HEY, ANY OF YOU GUYS SEEN AN
	AIRCRAFT CARRIER AROUND HERE?
	
	Cougar looks over, surprised.
	
			COUGAR
	WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
	
			MAVERICK
	EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE.
	..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU.
	YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
	
	Nothing happens.
	
			MAVERICK
	COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK. HALF ROLL 
	IT. NOW!
	
	
	Cougar's plane completes the roll, is now upright.
	
			GOOSE
	We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to 
	put it down.
	
			COUGAR
	It's crazy, man. Instruments are 
	crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
	
			GOOSE
	TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR 
	INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
	
			MAVERICK
	YOU'RE STRAIGHT AND LEVEL, COUGAR.
			COUGAR
	I'M HANGING IN MY STRAPS. I TURN IT 
	OVER AND I'M STILL HANGING IN MY 
	STRAPS. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON 
	UP HERE?
	
			MAVERICK
	YOU'RE NOT IN THE STRAPS.  IT'S 
	VERTIGO, THAT'S ALL IT IS. STAY ON 
	MY WING. I'LL DROP YOU OFF.
	
	Maverick pulls up wing tip to wing tip, inches apart.
	
			COUGAR
	MAVERICK.
	
			MAVERICK
	YEAH, COUGAR?
	
	
			COUGAR
	YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME...
	IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
	
			MAVERICK
	NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL.
		EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
	
			COUGAR
	I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M 
	GONNA EJECT.
	
			GOOSE
	Look at the weather! They'll never 
	find us! We're near out of fuel. 
	Put it down.
	
			MAVERICK
	COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
	
			COUGAR
	OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS 
	THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL 
	HAVE YOUR BUTT!
	
			GOOSE
	You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be 
	where your head used to be.
	
	
	28.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK 
	
	All eyes are on what they can see of the approach of the two 
	planes. Maverick drops him off at the pattern and circles. The 
	LSO watches the approach. The Tomcat drops a wing, straightens, 
	drops the wing, straightens ... the approach of a pilot 
	experiencing vertigo as Cougar tries to satisfy his inner ear.
	
			LSO
	LEVEL...YOUR WINGS... EASY... 
	YOU'RE SETTLING....FLY THE BALL.
	
	A wind shear just off the ramp drives the plane suddenly down.
	
			LSO
	POWER...POWER!..POWER!...WAVE OFF!  
	WAVE OFF  WAVE OFF!
	
	
	AFTERBURNERS BLAST, but the Tomcat horrifyingly settles tail-low 
	toward the deck. The deck crew watches in terror as the plane 
	wallows in toward them. The LSO'S turn, take a few steps and 
	throw themselves off the flight deck.
	
	They sail into the night toward the surging seas a hundred feet 
	below, then are caught in safety nets hung off the side.
	
	
	28A.  THE PLANE
	
	Settles, settles, standing on it's engines, trying to arrest 
	it's downward momentum. The hook raises sparks as it skids across 
	the deck... The plane stops falling and hangs for a moment, about 
	to blast back up, when the hook catches the last wire.. The wire 
	snags it, plucking 45,000 pounds of fuel, metal and men out of 
	the air and slamming it all to the deck. WHAMMMM! Right wheel 
	flies up the deck and over the side...the gear collapses. The 
	plane SCREECHES sideways. The crew watches helplessly as it skids 
	slams into it and comes to rest in cloud of fuel vapor and steam.
	
	The LSO runs up, shouting into the mike. 
	
			LSO
	COUGAR, GOOSE...COME IN COUGAR! 
	SHUT YOUR ENGINES DOWN, YOU'VE 
	ARRIVED.
	
			AIR BOSS
	GHOST RIDER! ACKNOWLEDGE!
	GHOST RIDER! ACKNOWLEDGE!
	
	Crash crew leaps into action. The fire crew is there. The man in 
	the Silver Suit jumps up on the wing and crawls to the cockpit. 
	The figures inside are not moving. He hits the canopy release. 
	The canopy pops open. Silver suit grabs at the rear seat harness 
	release. He screams through his suit's aluminized cloth...
	
			SILVER SUIT
	Goose, can you hear me?  Goose!
	
	Nothing for a moment. He's dead! Then the RIO'S helmet 
	moves...His head turns. He tears the mask away from his face, 
	looks up at Silver Suit. His head clears.
	
			GOOSE
	Oh, Hello... Valet parking?
	
	Silver suit is stunned for a moment. He straightens up, his head 
	inclines quizzically. Then it hits him.
	
			SILVER SUIT
	Son of a bitch!
	
			GOOSE
	You will put it up front,
	with the Porsches?
	
	He grabs him under the armpits, drags him out of the plane. 
	
			GOOSE
	Hey...easy...Take it easy...
	I'm a veteran!
	
	
	Goose grabs a passing crewman by the arm.
	
			GOOSE
	Can you check under the hood. I 
	thought I heard a funny noise.
	
	Other crewmembers help Cougar out. He seems stunned, but Goose 
	reacts to his fear with frantic one-liners. He grabs a crew 
	member's radio, as Silver Suit helps him away and looks to the 
	figures of the Admiral and the Air Boss far up on the bridge... 
	He waves to them, does his best impression...Desi Arnaz.
	
			GOOSE
	Lucy...Ricky...I'n Home!
	
	
	28B.  BRIDGE FLIGHT DECK
	
	A moment of disbelief... Then hysterical, tension relieving 
	laughter.
	
	
	28C.  FLIGHT DECK
	
	Goose spots Cougar being helped out. He pulls away, reaches back 
	into the cockpit and grabs Cougar's snapshot of wife and kid. 
	They lead Goose away as firemen blast the aircraft with foam.
	
			GOOSE
	Is it extra for the hot wax?
	
	28D.  BRIDGE  - FLIGHT DECK - AIR BOSS
	
			AIR BOSS
	Clear the flight deck.
	
	
	
	29.  FLIGHT DECK
	
	A TILLIE, a four wheel mobile crane, slams up to the plane and 
	slings its lifting harness. Goose turns to Silver Suit.
	
			GOOSE
	Well...there goes your tip.
	
	30.  INT. MAVERICK'S PLANE
	
	They have monitored the chatter. 
	
			WIZARD
	It's Goose. He's alright. Bring it 
	left...You're settling.  IS THE 
	DECK CLEAR?
	
			LSO (V.O. filtered)
	   (softly)
	ROGER, BALL, LITTLE POWER...DON'T 
	CLIMB...OKAY, HOLD WHAT YOU GOT! 
	
	Wizard does a quick sign of the cross, reaches down, grabs his 
	balls...as...
	
	
	30A.  FLIGHT DECK 
	
	The TOMCAT slams onto the deck, clearing the wreckage by inches.
	
	
	31.  INT. CARRIER HATCHWAY - FLIGHT SURGEON, OTHERS 
	
	Watch as they bring a shaken Cougar past. Goose, eyes wild, 
	waves at Maverick and Wizard, rolling up. They flame out - 
	VVOOOMMMMM! They sit there, immobile, waiting for a tow, looking 
	numb.  Goose does his "stewardess".
	
			GOOSE
	On behalf of your Captain and your 
	crew, I want to thank you for 
	flying VF101. And next time your 
	plans include the middle of the 
	goddamn ocean in the dead of 
	frigging night, I hope you'll think 
	of Naval Aviation.
	
	The surgeon looks into Goose's eyes.
	
			SURGEON
	Stress reaction...
	
			XO
	
	Check his head.
	
			GOOSE
	   (wobbling off)
	Never mind my head, check my 
	shorts!
	
	
	32.  SICK BAY - LATER
	
	Cougar lies alone in the dimness, staring at the overhead.
	
	33. 03 LEVEL - BELOW DECKS - OFFICER'S COUNTRY
	
	The usual CLANGS, WHISTLES, ENGINES of Navy life sound FORLORN 
	ECHOING through the dim, deserted passage. From the distance, a 
	single figure passes in and out of the glow of the overhead 
	lights. Cougar comes closer, hobbling unsteadily.
	
	He reaches a door, pulls himself erect and knocks on the sign:
	
	Commander Tom Otawoczek
	CO VF 101
	STINGER
	
	
	34.  STINGER'S CABIN
	
	The skipper works at his desk, responds without looking up.
	
			STINGER
	Come in.
	
	He looks up. Cougar stands in the doorway, a strange, dazed look 
	on his face.
	
			STINGER
	Cougar, what is it? You should be 
	in sick bay. What are you doing?
	
	He walks over to the skipper's desk. His eyes are glazed, but 
	his jaw is firm.
	
			COUGAR
	Thinking of my wife and kid.
	
	A determined movement. Hand to chest.
	
	
	34A. OMITTED
	
	Something metal hits it, skids across the polished surface and 
	clangs up against the coffee mug: gold wings.
	
	
	
	35.  PASSAGEWAY
	
	Cougar comes out of Stinger's room, bumps into Goose, and 
	Maverick. He turns the other way.
	
			GOOSE
	Cougar!
	
	He stops, turns to them. There is nothing to say. Goose hands 
	him his snapshot. Cougar looks at his wife and kid for a moment, 
	then looks up at them. He turns away.
	
			MAVERICK
	Cougar?		STINGER (O.S.)
	Maverick, Goose...Come in here.
	
	
	36.  STINGER'S OFFICE - DOORWAY
	
	Maverick appears, followed by Goose. They stand at 
	attention.
	
			MAVERICK
	Sir?
	
	The Skipper says nothing. Maverick sees the wings on the 
	desk. He enters, walks over, stares down at them. He picks 
	them up. 
	
			GOOSE
	Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
	
			STINGER
	Don't.
	
			MAVERICK
	He's a good pilot.
	
			STINGER
	I talked a man back once. Three 
	months later, we lost him. It's his 
	decision. Only he knows.
	
			GOOSE
	He's the best you have. He's going 
	Top Gun!
	
			STINGER
	Was.
	
			MAVERICK
	What?
	
	
			STINGER
	Was going. (Turns to Maverick.) Now 
	you are.
	
			MAVERICK
	Me?
	
	Maverick stares at the wings, lost in conflicting emotions.
	
			STINGER
	Well, he's going (indicating Goose) 
	and he needs someone to fly the 
	plane.
	
			GOOSE
	Skipper, you can't do this!
	
			STINGER
	I didn't do it, he did it himself. 
	Something about a wife and kid. The 
	fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. 
	I know it. You were up there, you 
	know it, too.
			GOOSE
	Give him a break, Skipper. It was 
	raining snakes up there. He'll be 
	alright, soon as all the gorillas go 
	home...
	
	The Skipper stares at Goose, non-plussed for a moment.
	
			STINGER
	I know some RIOS are a little 
	wiggy...but you abuse the 
	priviledge! I don't believe I'm 
	going to have to put the two of you 
	in the same cockpit...but there it 
	is! It may be good for the Navy. It 
	might be good for you, but most of 
	all, it's good for me. It'll get 
	you out of my sight.
	
	
			GOOSE
	But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked 
	for Top Gun...He's the best of the 
	best!
	
			STINGER
	Well, you'll just have to make do 
	with him (indicates Maverick).
	
	Goose and Maverick exchange looks.
	
	
			GOOSE
	Mav's a great flyer but....
	
			STINGER
	He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, 
	he's so damn good he might have 
	been picked for Top Gun himself. 
	Except for one thing. (SCREAMS) He 
	just can't seem to follow orders!
	
	
	Stinger moves slightly, to stand now, directly in front of 
	Maverick and speak eye to eye at four inches.
	
			STINGER
	You just did an incredibly brave thing! 
	What you should have done was land your 
	plane. You don't own that plane, the 
	taxpayers do. I should ream you out for 
	it. But it just doesn't work with you. 
	You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe 
	...too good. You never really stepped in 
	it yet. So this is your chance. I'm 
	gonna send you up against the best. They 
	are better than you. Maybe they'll knock 
	that shine off your eagle and you'll 
	see, finally, where discipline and 
	teamwork fit it. 
	Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out 
	of it.
	
			MAVERICK
	Sir?
	
			STINGER
	That is all. Tell me about the MiG 
	some other time...
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir!
	
	He snaps off a salute and does an about face.
	
			STINGER
	Maverick..
	
	He turns back.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir..
	
			STINGER
	The wings..
	
	
	He looks down at the wings in his hands, slowing walks over 
	places them gently on the Skipper's desk.
	
			STINGER
	Gentlemen!
	
			MAVERICK/GOOSE
	Sir?
	
	
	His facade cracks just slightly.
	
			STINGER
	Good luck.
	
	
	37.  INT. PASSAGEWAY
	
	Maverick and Goose push through a gauntlet of aircrews. They 
	have become notorious. Guys grab at them...questions...the 
	MiGs?..What happened up there? How close did they get? What did 
	the MiGs do? One word is heard over and over..."TopGun". Goose is 
	left behind in the crowd. Maverick pushes through. He walks 
	fast...faster. Up ladders, around turns, down ladders, through 
	passageways. Faster. He breaks into a trot, then a canter, 
	squeezing past enlisted men, parts lockers, then he breaks into a 
	run...
	
	38.  EXT - CARRIER - NIGHT AND STORM
	
	A hatch slams open on the side of the Carrier. He's out on a 
	catwalk, instantly soaked, running on rain slicked stairs 
	cantilevered high over the breaking seas. He plunges forward to 
	the bow of the ship, stands on the very peak. He is yelling 
	something. He stands there as the bow plunges terrifyingly into 
	the trough. The water rises like a green mountain, up, up to 
	break just a few feet below him, showering him with spray. The 
	noise is incredible. 
	
	Come around on his face. It is maddened. He raises his fist and 
	punches the night.
	
	
	The foaming slope of the wave rushes up, changing color as it 
	DISSOLVES TO:
	
	Desert Sand whipping by...
	
	39.  MOJAVE DESERT - 1 WEEK LATER
	
	A big bike, a real big bike, a turbo...rockets across the 
	desert. Fast. Real fast. Aviator shades low above the handlebars 
	--Maverick. Goose hangs on in back. It cranks faster, pulls 
	closer...ENGINE SCREAMING. It cranks up a notch, it's going to 
	
	explode. It can't go faster, but it does. It SCREAMS HIGHER. It 
	ROARS under, by and away, leaving dust...
	
	
	39A.  THE BIKE - STILL
	
	Silence. Just the HISS AND POP OF METAL COOLING. Maverick sits 
	on it, staring out past us. Goose looks over Maverick's shoulder.
	
	We see why. Feet come into the frame. Then the uniform: 
	California Highway Patrol.
	
	
	40.  COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR SAN DIEGO
	
	40A.  ANGLE ON MAVERICK. CHP enters the frame, the usual 
	hypercivil arrogance tinged with awed disbelief. The usual 
	questions are spaced for effect as if he might be talking to some 
	other form of life. Maverick is off the bike, standing at 
	attention. Goose follows more slowly.
	
			CHP
	Son. Do you know why
	I stopped you?
	
	Maverick has some good idea how to deal with authority.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir. I do sir
	
	The CHP adjusts his own aviator shades.
			CHP
	Well... What   is   it?
	
			MAVERICK
	   (more than sincere)
	Sir. You are going to give me a 
	warning, Sir!
	
	
	CHP - A touch of a smile, quickly surpressed.
	
			CHP
	License and registration.
	
	Maverick hands them over with his Navy ID. CHP scans them, 
	hesitates a moment over the last, looks up with a touch more 
	respect.
	
			CHP
	Lieutenant, do you know how fast  
	you were going?
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir. I do, Sir.
	
			CHP
	Well? 
	
			MAVERICK
	Sir. I was going Mach point one 
	five.
	
	CHP nods sagely.
	
			CHP
	One SIXTH the speed of sound!
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir.
	
			CHP
	   (a guess)
	Lieutenant... What do you...  
	usually fly?
	
			MAVERICK
	F-14's sir.
	
			CHP
	   (new respect)
	Tomcats?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir!
	
	A long pause. Respect in the cop's eyes. He taps the Navy ID on 
	the handlebars...staring at this sincere young man.
	
			CHP
	Lieutenant... Is there...
	a Russian attack?
	
			MAVERICK
	No sir! But you have to be ready. 
	
	
	The cop nods and stares at him.
	
	
	41.  EXT. MIRAMAR NAVAL AIR STATION - LATER
	
	
	41A.  OMIT
	
	
	The bike is BLURPING... barely going fast enough to stay 
	upright. Maverick cool in shades and campaign cap dorks past the 
	hanger with the sign: FIGHTERTOWN, USA. He pulls ahead. In back 
	of him, escorting with flashers...the CHP. They pull up at the 
	gate. Maverick and Goose salute the guard, hands over their ID. 
	The CHP gets out of his car, leans against the door.
	
			CHP
	Lieutenant.
	
	Maverick turns to him.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes, Sergeant?
	
			CHP
	Remember one thing.
	
			MAVERICK
	Sir?
	
			CHP
	Outside of this gate...
	I...am Top Gun.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir!
	
	He salutes. The CHP returns a snappy one. He gets back in his 
	car and turns away. Maverick receives his ID and clearance. As he 
	passes through, a couple of pilots in flight suits (ICE AND 
	HOLLYWOOD) stare at him. The taller, dark, cool one speaks in a 
	dry voice, meant to be overheard.
	
			ICE
	Uh oh, police escort. This one must 
	be a real killer.
	
	The second pilot grins big at them. Maverick turns slightly 
	stares over his shades at them as he passes. Goose grins back the 
	challenge.
	
	42.  AERIAL COMBAT - VIETNAM ERA - F4'S, MIG 17'S - STOCK 
	
	The Doors on the soundtrack.  Jets swoop, missiles fire, a plane 
	explodes. Gun camera views of MiGs, SAMS, flak, bombing runs...
	
			VIPER (V.O.) 
	During the Korean War, the Navy kill 
	ratio was twelve-to-one. We shot down 
	twelve of their jets for every one of 
	ours. In Vietnam, this ratio fell to 
	three-to-one. Our pilots depended on 
	missles. They lost their dogfighting 
	skills.
	
	
	
	F-14's fighting with F-5's. Music becomes current. 
	
			VIPER (V.O.) 
	Top Gun was created to teach ACM. Air 
	Combat Maneuvering...Dogfighting. 
	Richthofen, Guynemer, Rickenbacker, 
	Galland, Rudel, Bong would envy us. We 
	do just what they did, but we do it 
	beyond the speed of sound. 
	
	
	43.  INT. DAY - TOP GUN ORIENTATION ROOM.
	
	
	VIPER - A tough-looking, confident leader in a blue flight suit, 
	stands before a video-tape monitor. Behind him, on the monitor, 
	the dogfighting continues.
	
			VIPER
	By the end of Vietnam we upped our 
	kill ratio to thirteen to one. 
	
	
	He turns on the lights. We see his audience in F.G.
	
			VIPER
	You're here 'cause you're the top 
	one per cent of all naval aviators.
	
	THE CLASS 
	
	Sixteen young men - eight flight crews - sit at attention. They 
	are trim, fit and confident - high school heroes, college jocks.
	
			VIPER (V.O.) 
	You're the elite, the best of the 
	best. We're gonna make you better, 
	because you're job is damned 
	important. 
	
	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE MEN 
	
	The camera moves among them. Hold on one of the men; the one who 
	greeted Maverick at the gate, Ice.
	
			VIPER (V.O.)
	With the tensions in the world today, the potential for confron- 
	tation is greater than ever, and 
	carrier pilots will be the first 
	ones there. Air combat excellence 
	is vital.
	
	
	Ice is not looking at the speaker, but, rather, in our 
	direction. HOLLYWOOD, a blond, good-looking pilot, whispers 
	something to him, and gestures. Ice is getting the lowdown on 
	someone. The camera moves and we see who that someone is, as 
	Maverick enters the frame. 
	
			VIPER
	 ...Someone once asked me if 
	training men for air combat made 
	the world less safe--flying loaded 
	guns... an accidental confrontation 
	and so forth...
	
	Maverick feels the stare of the other man and glances in his 
	direction. Their eyes meet. Ice smiles coldly.
	
	
	ANGLE - VIPER 
	 		VIPER (Con't)
	My answer is: the dangerous thing 
	is being unprepared. You want 
	trouble, that's what you get when 
	things don't work out, when you 
	can't do what you say you can. When 
	you don't know what you can do. And 
	when your opponents aren't sure 
	either. We are not policy. We don't 
	make policy. Elected officials 
	...civilians, do that. We are the 
	instrument of policy. The tip of 
	the spear. So we had best be sharp.
	
	Maverick has turned to look at Ice. Ice glances back in his 
	direction. Maverick looks at the back of the room where guys in 
	blue flight suits stand. They are the instructors. They look 
	relaxed, poised, mean.  Goose is looking up front...Where Viper 
	has stopped. Goose nudges Maverick. 
	
			GOOSE
	   (whispers)
	What are you doing?
	
			MAVERICK
	Nothing...That's McGown...that's 
	Singer, isn't it?
			GOOSE
	Turn around, pay attention. What 
	are you doing?
	
			MAVERICK
	    (musing to himself)
	...Just wondering...(turns back) 
	...who is the best.
	
	
	He's shocked to find Viper staring right at him, with a killer 
	grin on his face. He's feels caught like a naughty schoolboy.
	
			VIPER
	Really...    (smiles)
	Ya know. We'd like to know who's 
	best too. That's why we've got that 
	plaque on the wall... with the Top 
	Top Gun crew from each class. You 
	think maybe your name's gonna be on 
	it?
	
	Maverick knows he's in trouble, considers the social 
	alternatives, then tells him the truth.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir.
	
	A couple of ooo's and aahh's from the guys. The instructors 
	stare the challenge at him. He slides lower in his seat.
	
			VIPER
	Considering the company you're in, 
	that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
	
			MAVERICK
	    (somewhat chastised)
	Yes sir.
	
			VIPER
	I like that in a fighter pilot.  
	(couple of laughs from the guys) 
	It's okay to be confident. You have 
	to think you're King Kong to want 
	to try to land on carriers. Just 
	keep in mind the other component of 
	success...teamwork.
	
	Viper gathers his notes, the lecture is over.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yes sir.
	
	Viper turns back for one more thought.
	
			VIPER
	Gentlemen, this is about combat. 
	Remember, there are no points for 
	second place. Dismissed.
	Viper walks out. Maverick finds Goose looking at him, 
	quizzically. Others mill around the plaque.  A big, friendly bear 
	of a RIO speaks.
	
	
	
			WOLFMAN
	A plaque?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	It's not the plaque. The winner can 
	get assigned here as instructor. He 
	gets to fight every day.
	
	They move closer to examine the names on the plaque.
	
	
	44.  EXT. "O" CLUB - NIGHT.
	
	Fast cars in the driveway, fast music blares into the 
	night. It's Wednesday; Animal Night. Maverick, Goose 
	Hollywood and Wolfman walk to the entrance.
	
	
	
	45.  INT. WOXOF BAR
	
	
	Loud music, low ceiling, plaques of the squadrons line the 
	walls. A dancer gyrates on stage, largely ignored by pilots 
	talking with their hands. Every pretty girl in San Diego 
	seems to be here. It's a noisy, rowdy place--a "steam 
	releaser" for people under pressure. Nevertheless, there is 
	a control to it all, there are none of the usual bar types, 
	just pilots and Naval Officers.
	
	The Ghost Riders enter. The place is on fire:  a mob of 
	dancers, flashing lights, blaring HARD ROCK MUSIC. Beer 
	flows. Pilots talk flying and hustle girls.
	
	NEARBY - AN A7 pilot stands by the bar. He knows Goose and 
	speaks loudly for his benefit.. 
	
			A7 PILOT
	You know the Fighter Pilots motto? 
	It's better to be dead than to look 
	bad.
	
	They grin broadly. Goose replies as they brush past.
	
			GOOSE
	I don't know, Frank, anybody gets 
	off on bombing the shit out of dirt 
	has got to be queer.
	
	Goose exchanges friendly punches with the attack pilots. 
	Maverick's introductions and friendly barbs are drowned by the 
	music. Maverick is a bit reserved. He doesn't move among the 
	crowd as naturally as Goose does. Hollywood and Wolfman drift 
	
	away, searching for quarry. Goose orders beer. He nods toward a 
	TALL YOUNG MAN across the room.
	
			GOOSE
	Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew 
	him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
	
			MAVERICK
	Is there anybody in the Navy you 
	don't know? 
	
			GOOSE
	Gotta keep track of the 
	competition.
	
	Goose suddenly reaches out and grabs a guy moving past.
	
			GOOSE
	Slider -- they let you into Top 
	Gun? If you're among the best in 
	the Navy, I tremble for the 
	security of this country.
	
			SLIDER
	Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss 
	to get here?
	
			GOOSE
	The list is long, but 
	distinguished.
	
			SLIDER
	So's my Johnson.
	
			GOOSE
	This is Maverick.
	
	Smiles good-naturedly, shakes hands with Mav. 
	
			SLIDER
	So I've heard.
	
			GOOSE
	Who's your pilot?
	
			SLIDER
	Tom Kazansky.
	
			GOOSE
	    (very impressed)
	No shit. The Iceman....
	
			SLIDER
	Mister to you.
	
	
			GOOSE
	You think you can stay up with us.
	
			SLIDER
	I think, yeah, we'll show you a 
	thing or two.
	
			GOOSE
	This is Evan Mitchell, he steers 
	the thing. 
	
			SLIDER
	So I heard. Steers it pretty close. 
	Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was 
	a good man.
	
			MAVERICK
	Still is..
			SLIDER
	Yeah. That's what I meant.
	
	Suddenly, behind them, a flame shoots up. Someone ducks his head 
	and swallows it. The pilot sets an empty glass on the bar.
	
			SLIDER
	What was that?
	
			GOOSE
	Flaming Hooker. Sort of an 
	institution around here. Or maybe 
	this is the institution, I forget 
	which. It's the house drink. It'll 
	warm the cockles of your heart ... 
	and other things depending on where 
	you spill it.
	
	He motions to the barmaid and she moves over, sets them up. 
	GOOSE holds a demitasse glass. The barmaid pours Drambuie. They 
	look at Goose apprehensively. Goose looks at nearby flyers in 
	Camo fatigues.
			GOOSE
	You can't show fear in front of 
	Marines...They're like Doberman's 
	they'll go for your throat, it's 
	instinctive.
	
	He takes out match and lights it. Maverick holds his arm.
	
			MAVERICK
	You ever done this before?
	
			GOOSE
	What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
	
	
	He downs it all in one gulp, slaps the glass on the bar, still 
	aflame. He stands there, blinking. 
	
			SLIDER
	How was it?
	
			GOOSE
	Could use a dash more jet fuel.
	
	The others are duly impressed. Maverick's gaze falls on Ice 
	watching from the end of the bar - Slider takes one, Maverick 
	takes one too, downs it in a gulp. Sundown, taking up the 
	challenge, motions for one. The barmaid pours it.
	
			GOOSE
	Careful, don't make an ash of 
	yourself...
	
	He tries to drink the flaming concoction. He tries to go for a 
	sip, but it's too close to his face, he tries to tilt the flame 
	away, but that doesn't work. Finally he goes for the gulp. He 
	burns his lip and misses.  He sets his hair on fire. It goes up 
	in a WHOOOSH!!
	
			SUNDOWN
	Yeow!
	
			GOOSE
	Mayday! Down in flames! 
	
	He throws a beer in Sundown's face, quenching the fire. Sundown 
	blinks through the beer.
	
			SUNDOWN
	Thanks, I needed that.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	You guys are not only crazy, you're 
	dangerous!
	
	Ice comes up from the end of the bar. He motions the Barmaid for 
	another; it comes. Goose lights it. He gulps it down, cool as 
	hell.
			ICE
	    (Disdainfully)
	Frat boys.
	
	
	He walks away. Slider goes after him.
	
			MAVERICK
	Who is that guy?
	
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	That's Kazanski.
	
			GOOSE
	No shit! That why they call him Ice?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Nope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. 
	No mistakes. Wears you down. After 
	enough time, you just get bored and 
	frustrated, you do something stupid, and 
	he's got you.
	
	Maverick moves in Ice's direction. He passes Wolfman dancing 
	with a girl with bright purple fingernails.
	
	ANGLE - DANCEFLOOR.
	
			GIRL
	Why do you all have such funny 
	names?
	
			WOLFMAN
	You gotta have a call sign that's 
	just your own...never changes...you 
	have to recognize it immediately. 
	Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, 
	break left!"..you react right away.
	
			GIRL
	Why do they call you Wolf?
	
			WOLDFMAN
	   (smiles)
	Oh, I don't know.
	
	Goose comes up with his arm around a girl.
	
			GOOSE
	Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't 
	believe a word I say. Tell her I'm 
	married, will you?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yeah, he's married--but then again, 
	he,s not dead.
	
	Sally laughs and tries to pull Goose back toward the dance 
	floor. Something in Maverick's eyes makes him hang back with his 
	partner.
	ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR - DANCERS
	
			GIRL
	Could I get a call sign?
	
	
			WOLFMAN
	Well, I don't know. That depends.
	
			GIRL
	On what?
	
			WOLFMAN
	Well, it doesn't just happen, you 
	gotta do something famous.
	
			GIRL
	Like what?
	
			WOLFMAN
	Oh...I'll think of something.
	
	Maverick smiles at this, but seems on edge... He watches a few 
	pretty girls enter and eye the pilots in their flight suits, then 
	turns and walks up to Ice, who sits, drinking with Slider.
	Maverick walks over to him. Ice notices Slider's attention going 
	to Maverick. He turns and grins at him.
	
			ICEMAN
	Figured it out yet?
	
			MAVERICK
	Figured out what?
	
			ICEMAN
	Who is the best.
	
			MAVERICK
	Nope.
	
			ICEMAN
	Need a hint?
	
			MAVERICK
	I think I can work it out on my 
	own.
	
			ICEMAN
	You like to work alone. I've heard 
	that about you. 
	
			MAVERICK
	I've heard of you, too. You were in 
	124 with Bargamian.
	
			ICEMAN
	And you were with Cougar. He was my 
	roommate in flight school.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	He's a good man.
			ICEMAN
	The best.
	
			SLIDER
	You must have soloed under a lucky 
	star. First the MiG, then you slide 
	into Cougar's place.
	
			GOOSE
	It's not Cougar's place. It's ours. 
	
			ICE
	What do you think it was? Was it 
	that MiG contact that did it?
	
			GOOSE
	Did what?
	
			ICE
	Got you here.
	
			GOOSE
	We're here because we're the best 
	flyers in the wing. Not because of 
	some MiG encounter.
	
			SLIDER
	What luck! Guys fly their whole 
	career without seeing a MiG up 
	close...You're famous.
	
			ICE
	You mean notorious.
	
	Something in the way he says it. It's not quite a joke, more an 
	insult. Maverick's about to take the whole conversation too far 
	when something...someone catches his eye. She catches quite a few 
	eyes in this room. She is very pretty and she's walking in on the 
	arm of a Commander. Maverick turns back, but the moment has 
	passed. Ice dismisses him with a nod and weak smile. Goose pulls 
	him away.
	
			MAVERICK
	What do these guys think, I made 
	Cougar quit?
	
			GOOSE
	Pay no attention to it. They're 
	just trying to rattle you. It's all 
	psychological. Sit down..and drink.
	
	
	He deposits Maverick at a chair by a table where other pilots 
	cluster watching and listening to Bugs shoot down his wristwatch. 
	Maverick broods...
			BUGS
	We were just really diving down and by 
	then we were right over downtown 
	Haiphong.  It was some great shit. Jack 
	says, "What are you doing?" "What, what 
	am I doing, Jack?" He says, "What are 
	you doing?" I said, "I'm rolling in, 
	Jack." "Bugs, we're at thirty-two 
	hundred feet. Oh shit, we were like 
	zooom... So we scraped down at hundred 
	feet right over--downtown Hanoi!  Oh 
	shit, goddamn it! And blowing down the 
	river. And so once we were there we let 
	down to about fifty feet just going down 
	the river and Jack says... "Bugs... 
	don't ever do that again!" "Okay, right, 
	Jack, I'll never do that again!"
	
	Maverick pays little or no attention. He broods and drinks. 
	Suddenly, Hollywood nudges him, he turns.
	
			MAVERICK
	What, what is it?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Target passing. Check your six.
	
			MAVERICK
	Never mind mine. Check hers.
	
	They turn. Long legs, great ass, beautiful.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	Her six is a ten! Uh oh, a turn to 
	engage.
	
	
	
	HIS POV - ACROSS A CROWDED ROOM
	
	Maverick sees a stranger, and somehow he knows, he knows even 
	then.  Wolfman turns, sees her walking too.
	
			WOLFMAN
	Bogey...9 o'clock level.
	
			SUNDOWN
	Nine thirty. Bogey?  You presume 
	that hostile?
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	
	Well, we should contact and check 
	it out.
	
	
	She has turned toward them. She passes by. They start to make a 
	move for her. But just then she finds her date at the bar; a 
	distinguished man with Captain's stripes. Their smiles freeze and 
	they slide back in their chairs. Maverick can't stop looking at 
	her...After a while, the intensity of his gaze draws her 
	attention. She feels him. She is nodding and smiling to her date, 
	but her eyes scan the room like radar. A warning tone goes off in 
	his brain dolu dolu dolu as they lock on him. He feels that 
	thrill of excitement and fear you get when you know you're 
	targeted in someone's scope. Her eyes hold on him for a long 
	moment...long enough, and then sweep by the rest of the room. She 
	turns her attention back to the Captain and laughs at something 
	he says.
	
	
	Over in a corner, Goose chats up a couple of San Diego girls.
	
			GOOSE
	The family unit -- that's the most 
	important thing. It's the only 
	thing you can count on. I'm married 
	--did I tell you that?
	
			FIRST GIRL
	Four times. We don't believe you.
	
			GOOSE
	I've been married since I was 
	eighteen. Why don't you believe me?
	
			SECOND GIRL
	Because you don't look married. 
	
			FIRST GIRL
	You're not even wearing a ring.
	
			GOOSE
	    (big smile)
	I take it off when I'm chasing 
	women. It's the only honorable 
	thing to do.
	
	
	ANGLE - MAVERICK
	
	He's half listening to Bugs rattle on.  His eyes are drawn back 
	to the woman. He tries not to stare. She seems to know a lot of 
	people in the club. He looks away. Hollywood is chatting up a 
	girl with a sincerity that cannot be taught. His line is just as 
	polished as his appearance.
	
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	You don't think about death up 
	there, but you think a lot about 
	the danger. One mistake and you're 
	a smoking hole in the ground.
	
			GIRL
	I never knew it was so dangerous.
			HOLLYWOOD
	Oh yeah, it makes everything down 
	here more meaningful. You feel a 
	certain intensity of life, and you 
	want to grab onto every moment.
	
	Maverick looks up at the bar again. A shock. She (Charlie) is 
	staring right at him, intensely, as her date whispers something 
	in her ear. She notices him, staring back, quickly looks away, 
	embarrassed. She says something to the man. He nods and turns 
	away as someone else grabs his attention. The woman, now wouldn't 
	look this way for anything. She picks up her purse from the bar 
	and walks through the crowd and out of the room. Impulsively, 
	Maverick's up, he follows. 
	
	
	46.  INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE THE BAR
	
	He breaks out, looks around, doesn't see her. Someone disappears 
	around a corner. He moves after.
	
	CORNER - A door slams shut. Impulsively, before he realizes what 
	he is doing, he's through it. 
	
	
	47.  WOMEN'S ROOM. 
	
	A feminine GASP!  He should have looked at the sign on the door. 
	The realization of where he is hits him too late. She is standing 
	by the mirror, with her make-up out, looking back at him. He's 
	not quite sure what to do. A hasty retreat would be appropriate, 
	if embarrassing. Ah, what the hell, he is a fighter pilot!  He 
	just walks right over to her...no idea what he will say. She's 
	got her lipstick out, twisting it. She looks over at him with an 
	amused smile.
	
			CHARLIE
	Long cruise, was it?
	
	She leans over the sink, puts on lipstick, sees his eyes cover 
	her.
	
			CHARLIE
	Anything I can do to help, Lieutenant?
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Lots of things. 
	
	She laughs. He is sort of attractive, but there are other girls 
	in the room, she doesn't want to be too encouraging...She tries 
	not to grin at his embarrassment.
	
			CHARLIE
	I'll bet!
	
			MAVERICK
	Uhhh...Anything I can do for you?
	She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, 
	but she's instinctively attracted.
	
			CHARLIE
	Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
	
	She hands him a makeup mirror. Starts redoing her lipstick. He 
	just stares at her...She looks up at him, than back to her 
	warpaint. Finally, when it comes, it is cool and amused.
	
			CHARLIE
	Now I know why all the girls come 
	here. They know how horny you guys 
	get. But this...is ridiculous.
	
			MAVERICK
	It's not that.
	
	Mock anger. She's toying with him.
	
			CHARLIE
	It isn't?
	
			MAVERICK
	Well, it is. It is that, too.
	
			CHARLIE
	That's a big comfort to me.
	
			MAVERICK
	I could be, too.
	
	 		CHARLIE
	How so?
	
			MAVERICK
	Save you from a big mistake with 
	that other guy.
	
			CHARLIE
	And on to a bigger one with you?
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Yeah, most likely.
	
			CHARLIE
	Was there ever a girl who didn't 
	like fighter pilots?
	
			MAVERICK
	I heard of one once.
	
	She laughs again, shakes her head...another cowboy! She gently 
	takes the compact out of his hands, snaps it closed.
	
			CHARLIE
	I'm really flattered, Lieutenant, 
	but I don't go out with pilots.
			MAVERICK
	Then what are you doing here?
	
	Three pretty blondes enter and look at Maverick quizzically but 
	not without interest.
	
			CHARLIE
	I think the question is...what are 
	you?
	
	She tries to keep a straight face as she walks out of the room. 
	
	The other girls look at him expectantly.  A beat.  He just 
	stands there, then realizes he's holding her lipstick. 
	
			MAVERICK
	Hi. I'm here to talk about a new 
	concept in cosmetics...
	
	47A.  WOXOF BAR. She returns, spots the Captain, motioning to 
	her.  Maverick enters, goes to the other end of the bar. He 
	orders a drink. It comes. He drinks it, pays for it, moves off 
	toward the door. Someone backs into his path, he moves quickly 
	and bumps into someone else; her. 
	
			CHARLIE
	Sorry.
	
	She sees it's him.
	
			MAVERICK
	My fault. Should have watched
	where I was going.
	
	Her hand goes to his collar. She adjusts his insignia. She 
	smiles.
	
			CHARLIE
	
	Where's your wing man? Who's 
	watching your six?
	
			MAVERICK
	Uh, nobody, I guess.
	
	One final adjustment.
	
			CHARLIE
	Too bad.
	
	She breaks the spell abruptly, turns away.
	
			CHARLIE
	See you around.
	
	Maverick finds his voice.
	
			MAVERICK
	Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
	
			CHARLIE
	I'm with someone. 
	
	
	48.  EXT. "O" CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT
	
	P.O.V. - 
	
	From a car in the parking lot, we see Charlie and the Captain 
	leave the club. They walk directly toward us and stop. She turns, 
	says something polite...a peck on the cheek. He turns away. A 
	dome light briefly illuminates the interior of the car as a door 
	opens. It rocks slightly as someone gets in. Charlie turns back 
	and walks over, taking her keys out. She opens the door to the 
	car and gets in. 
	
	
	48A.  EXT. CAR - NIGHT
	
	She starts the car and pulls away. Suddenly, a figure sits up in 
	the back.
	
			MAVERICK
	I thought he'd never leave.
	
			CHARLIE
	Yeow!
	
	Startled, she nearly drives off the road. She turns to him, 
	startled.
	
			CHARLIE
	You! What are you doing here?
	
	
			MAVERICK
	Everybody's got to be somewhere.
	
			CHARLIE
	What if Captain Dawson had come 
	with me?
	
			MAVERICK
	It would have been really 
	embarrassing!
	
			CHARLIE
	How did you know this was my car?
	
			MAVERICK
	Simple deduction. It's fast. It's 
	pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's 
	your color...matches your lipstick.
	
			CHARLIE
	That's all!
	
			MAVERICK
	And I asked someone.
			CHARLIE
	You think you're pretty smart.
	
			MAVERICK
	I think I'm in love.
	
	
	49.  EXT. GUARD GATE
	
	She pulls up at the guard gate, a MARINE CORPORAL is on duty. He 
	sees the pretty girl pull up and stop, leans over helpfully.
	
			MARINE
	Can I help you, Ma'am?
	
	She smiles even more sweetly.
	
			CHARLIE
	I don't know, Corporal. Can you do 
	anything about this lunatic?
	
	The car door swings open. Maverick gets out. The car roars away. 
	He stands in the glare of the spotlight...rocking on his heels, 
	looking across at the guard, who snaps to attention and stares 
	holes in his chest.
	
	
	50.  INT. TOP GUN - NEXT MORNING. 
	
	
	Two guys in flight suits run down stairs past stencils of MiG 
	kills on walls, then down corridor.
	
			FLEX
	Not so fast...my head.
	
	They skid to stop outside a door.
	
	
	51.  INT. HANGAR
	
	Ground crews work on planes in B.G. Jester in middle of lecture.
	Door bursts open. Sundown and Flex skid to a halt when they see 
	whole class looking at them.
	
			JESTER
	Who are you?
