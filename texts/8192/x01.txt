			ICE
	STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, 
	MAVERICK.
	
			MAVERICK
	YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
	
	
	MAVERICK - ABOVE.
	
			MAVERICK
	ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
	
			ICE
	NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
	
	
	Maverick is pulling a log of G's, but can't target his 
	weapons, he continues to turn in a hard circle, going round 
	and round without gaining. He can't bring his nose to bear.
	
			MAVERICK
	IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
	
			ICE
	NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
	
	Ice stays.
	
			MAVERICK
	COMING IN.
	
	Maverick dives down between the two planes pulling 6.5 G's, 
	exposing his underside to Ice. All Ice sees is belly. 
	Obviously, in this attitude Maverick can't see him.
	
			ICE
	    (under breath.)
	Sonofabitch.
	
	He slams the stick hard right in toward Maverick. 
	Ice quickly rolls up right, in front of him.
	
			ICE
	LOOK OUT!
	
	
	Maverick sees him flash into his view. He has to slam the 
	stick forward to avoid collision. He swings by real close. 
	Too close.
	
			GOOSE
	Oh, no!
	
	
	
	They pass through Ice's turbulence. The blast distorts the 
	airflow to Maverick's left engine. BOOMBOOMBOOM. The engine 
	flames out. Full thrust on the right, engine swings the tail 
	around in a yaw. Maverick slams the stick right to correct 
	but too late.
	
			GOOSE
	Plane's coupling up! Plane's 
	coupling up!
	
	
	The plane couples one yaw to the next--the tail swings 
	around-- which becomes an ever increasing flat spin, like an 
	out-of -control frisbee.
	
			GOOSE
	This is not good!...(Rising panic) 
	We're low!
	
	
	Maverick is pinned to the instrument panel by centrifugal 
	force, desperately tries to reach back for the ejection 
	lever--but is falling short by about a foot.
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm pinned to the panel.
	
			GOOSE
	Time to go.
	
			MAVERICK
	I can't eject.
	
	
	The plane is spinning ever faster, out of control. He drops 
	the gear. Still spins. Goose is closer to center of spin--G 
	forces are less. He reaches behind him for the eject handle, 
	starts the eject sequence.
	
			GOOSE
	3000 feet. I'll do it.
	
			MAVERICK
	Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
	
	
	85A.  BOOM - A HURRICANE OF WIND AND NOISE
	
	The canopy BLASTS away--but is held spinning above the 
	cockpit by the vortex of the sinking jet. Goose glances up at 
	it.
	
			GOOSE
	1000.
	
			MAVERICK
	Let's go. Eject.
	
	
	Goose yanks the ejection handle. Things happen in a split 
	second. Goose is fired up and out by the rocket under his 
	seat. Almost instantly he impacts the spinning canopy. A 
	sickening CRUNCH. The canopy is knocked away. Maverick is 
	slammed back in his seat as the ejection seat straps wind up. 
	He is BLASTED out of the plane just before it spins in.
	
	
	85B.  TIGHT ON MAVERICK AS HE TUMBLES IN SLOW MOTION
	
	He's in shock..the loud THUMPING of his heart, labored 
	breathing, a scream that stays in his mind.
	
	Instinctively, he gropes for straps. He releases the pilot 
	seat, it tumbles away. His chute streams, balloons open, 
	snapping his body like a bullwhip.  He drifts momentarily, 
	then plunges into the sea.
	
	
	85C. UNDERWATER
	
	His face, distorted in the water; wild eyes, disoriented, 
	choking for air. He reaches out, finds nothing to grab.
	Suddenly, he is yanked hard to the side.
	
	
	85D.  SURFACE 
	
	The parachute is caught by the wind, and dragged, pulling 
	Maverick along beneath the surface. He is twisting in the 
	water, turning over and over, trying desperately to slip out 
	of the tangled straps. He finally hits the surface of the 
	water and sucks air into his lungs. With the end of his 
	strength, he hits the release snaps and breaks free from the 
	parachute. It whips away like a kite in a typhoon.
	
	The sea is choppy and rough. He struggles as his equipment 
	drags him under. He twists, finds the inflatable raft 
	attached to his harness. Maverick pulls the cord, and the 
	raft hisses open. He pulls his body into the six-by-two foot 
	raft and collapses, completely exhausted. The survival has 
	been almost without thinking: an instinctual physical 
	struggle.
	
	
	85E.  TWILIGHT
	
	Maverick begins to focus on the situation. He stains the 
	water with dye, then sees another parachute floating nearby. 
	Paddling to the parachute, he reaches over the side and 
	begins to pull on the heavy cords that are submerged in the 
	water.
	
	A great struggle. The weight is extremely heavy. Finally, he 
	pulls a body to the surface. Goose. Goose is dead. Maverick 
	releases the parachute and pulls Goose into the raft on top 
	of him. He holds Goose in his arms. His mind shuts down 
	again.
	
	From high above the ocean, we see the debris on the water. 
	An oil slick, pieces of honeycomb titanium, and the small, 
	helpless figure in the raft.
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	86.  EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
	
	Searchlights skim over the black ocean. A brilliant light 
	flashes as Maverick pops a pencil flare. Helicopter blades 
	flick powerfully. The lights of the choppers descend toward 
	the wreckage area, scanning the debris, searching for life. 
	The spotlights find Maverick and Goose in the raft.
	
	The draft from the chopper churns the water. A FROGMAN drops 
	from the chopper and hits with a heavy splashes. He surfaces 
	and swims to the raft as a rescue harness is lowered.
	
	Maverick watches curiously as he starts to examine Goose. He 
	hugs Goose closer and looks threatened.
	
	
			FROGMAN
	Let him go, sir. Take it easy.
	
	He tries to pry Goose free, but Maverick has a death grip on 
	the body.
	
			FROGMAN
	Sir! Let him go. It's all right. 
	Let him go.
	
	
	Maverick glares at the man as he bobs in the water.
	
	Another long moment, then Maverick releases Goose. The 
	frogman quickly straps Maverick into the harness. 
	
	HIS POV. - He watches the lifeless body in the water as he 
	is pulled up and away. He shivers from the cold.
	
	
	87.  INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Extreme CLOSE ON Maverick's face. He is emotionless. His 
	eyes are flat and absolutely without expression. There is 
	complete silence in the room. Then we hear the quiet, calm, 
	probing voice of Viper.
	
			VIPER
	How do you feel?
	
			MAVERICK
	All right.
	
			VIPER
	Goose is dead.
	
			MAVERICK
	I know. I was there.
	
	
	
	Not one sign of emotion from Maverick. Not one tone of 
	expression. We see Viper now, and his face is strained from a 
	very long day.
	
			VIPER
	If you fly jets long enough, 
	something like this happens to you. 
	No one escapes it. It touches us 
	all.
	
	Maverick looks at Viper, and his eyes are very disturbed.
	
			MAVERICK
	He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
	
			VIPER
	My first squadron in Vietnam, we 
	lost eight out of eighteen planes. 
	Ten guys. The first one kills you, 
	but there'll be others--you can 
	count on it.
	
	
	No reaction from Maverick. He can't quite face up to that 
	reality right now.
	
			VIPER
	You've got to put him in the box.
	
	
	Maverick is watching Viper, but he doesn't have anything to 
	say.
	
	
	88.  EXT. CHARLIE'S SPORTSCAR - NIGHT
	
	The RADIO plays John Lennon; "Stand by Me". Maverick opens 
	his eyes, doesn't know where he is for a moment.
	
			CHARLIE
	...they say you're alright.
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm fine.
	
			CHARLIE
	This is it, then.
	
			MAVERICK
	What?
	
			CHARLIE
	The dark side. The price you pay 
	for all the fun you're having. You 
	knew about it, of course. Didn't 
	you?
	
			MAVERICK
	He was a friend of mine. A good 
	guy...great guy. It was my 
	fault.
	
			CHARLIE
	That's not what I hear.
	
			MAVERICK
	I was flying...my responsibility.
	
			CHARLIE
	That's what you get flight pay for.
	
			MAVERICK
	Maybe I shouldn't take it.
	
			CHARLIE
	    (In surprise)
	Why? You act like you didn't know 
	one day this would happen.
	
			MAVERICK
	Not to me.
	
			CHARLIE
	You knew it. You all do. It's part 
	of it. Maybe the most important 
	part.
	
	
	88A.  ON THE BEACH - NIGHT AND FOG 
	
	Charlie's car pulls up. They get out and walk down toward 
	the water. Maverick seems dazed. She is softly taunting.
	
			MAVERICK
	Where are we?
	
			CHARLIE
	Where are we? You know where we 
	are. It's called the beach. It's 
	where life first crawled up out of 
	the sea. I come here sometimes... 
	when I feel like crawling back in.
	
			MAVERICK
	You don't have to do this.
	
			CHARLIE
	Do what, show you a good time?
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm not good company. I should be 
	alone.
	
			CHARLIE
	I don't think so, but if that's 
	what you want...
	
	They stand there, not making a move.
	
			MAVERICK
	No.
	
			CHARLIE
	What do you want?
	
			MAVERICK
	I want it back.
	
			CHARLIE
	What?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yesterday.
	
	She turns, nods out, past the moon.
	
			CHARLIE
	You look way out there. Out past 
	the date line. West becomes East, 
	all things change. You cross the 
	line...today becomes yesterday...or 
	tomorrow, I forget which.
	
			MAVERICK
	That's what I want.
	
			CHARLIE
	Of course the line's just 
	imaginary. You can cross it twenty 
	times...nothing really changes.
	
	She turns and walks along the surfline.
	
			CHARLIE
	On the beach... It's what they say 
	when Navy men retire...He's "On The 
	Beach". I always liked that. I had 
	a picture...in my head... all these 
	old guys wandering around here, 
	looking out into the past.
	
	He walks to the surf, kicks the sand with his bare feet.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	If we knew then, what we know now, 
	we might never have come up out of 
	there.
	
	He turns to her. She just looks at him.
	
			CHARLIE
	You don't believe that.
	
			MAVERICK
	Hardly ever.
	
			CHARLIE
	Only when you're depressed. Then it 
	passes.
	
			MAVERICK
	It does.
	
			CHARLIE
	Everything passes. Immutable law of 
	the Universe.
	
	
	He picks up a piece of flotsam, a twig, worn smooth.
	
			CHARLIE
	This too...shall pass. You put as 
	much life as you can between it and 
	you. You start piling up experience 
	between then and now.
	
	He turns and walks.
	
			MAVERICK
	What do you do when you come here?
	
			CHARLIE
	I sit. I think. I play games.
	
			MAVERICK
	What kind of games?
	
			CHARLIE
	I like to play "reality".
	
	She stops and turns.
	
			MAVERICK
	How do you play reality.
	
			CHARLIE
	It's strip reality, actually, like 
	what the pilots always want to 
	play.
	
			MAVERICK
	  (this gets a small laugh)
	Strip reality! How do you play 
	that?
	
			CHARLIE
	It's like strip poker, only, 
	without the bluffing. (he laughs 
	again) One person says something 
	and if the other one accepts that 
	it's true, the one who says it, 
	gets to take one item of clothing 
	off.
	
			MAVERICK
	You're crazy. (She stops, he goes 
	on, softer) That's a pretty silly 
	game.
	
			CHARLIE
	Not as silly as some. You know the 
	silliest one? ...that we are gods. 
	That we control events on the 
	beach... that we can turn back 
	time...
	
	She moves in close.
	
			CHARLIE
	Want to play the game? 
	
			MAVERICK
	How does it go?
	
			CHARLIE
	You say the truth. (a beat...)    
	Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want 
	to win the game, don'tcha?
	
			MAVERICK
	What truth?
	
			CHARLIE
	The big one. The one that's most on 
	your mind.
	
	A long pause...it comes hard.
	
			MAVERICK
	Goose is dead.
	
			CHARLIE
	    (she nods)
	True.
	
			MAVERICK
	Now?
	
			CHARLIE
	Take something off.
	
			MAVERICK
	Off me or off you?
	
			CHARLIE
	That's up to you.
	
	
	He takes the ribbon from her hair. It falls down over her 
	face and shoulders. Now it's her turn.
	
			CHARLIE
	It's dangerous...what you do.
	
	He nods. She slowly loosens his tie and pulls it from around 
	his neck.
	
			MAVERICK
	It was my fault.
	
	
	She says nothing, stands looking into his eyes. He slowly, 
	as if in a trance, takes her blouse off.
	
			CHARLIE
	You can't bring him back.
	
	She takes off his shirt.
	
			MAVERICK
	It was my fault.
	
	
	
	He starts to reach for her. She pulls back.
	
			CHARLIE
	Nope. Already used that.
	
	She turns and thinks for a moment, looking at the moon.
	
			CHARLIE
	Your life goes on.
	
	
	Rather than struggle his T shirt over his head, she grabs it 
	with both hands. She leans in close and bites it. She grabs 
	both sides of the tear and slowly rips it off his body.
	
	
			MAVERICK
	What does it mean?
	
			CHARLIE
	   (shakes her head no)
	That wasn't fair. It was a 
	question. Penalty round!
	
	
	She drops her skirt.
	
			CHARLIE
	You didn't mean it. You didn't 
	think. You'd do anything to take it 
	back.
	
			MAVERICK
	That's three.
	
			CHARLIE
	And that's one!
	
	
	She unbuckles his belt, slowly slides it off. She unzips his 
	pants, they fall.
	
			MAVERICK
	One more.
	
			CHARLIE
	Your watch.
	
	She unbuckles it.
	
			MAVERICK
	You owe me one.
	
	
	He rests his head on her shoulder, unhooks her bra. She 
	shrugs it off.
	
	They stand on the beach in shorts and bikini bottom, looking 
	into each other's eyes.
	
			CHARLIE
	Looks like a tie.
	
			MAVERICK
	Who's gonna win?
	
			CHARLIE
	We'll say it together. On the count 
	of three...One...two...
	
	Leaning in, softer and harder...they both jump the gun.
	
			BOTHTOGETHER
	I love.ove y.you.
	
	They embrace madly and sink to the sand. From the distance 
	it looks like a strange slithering creature crawling back to 
	the sea.
	
	
	89.  INT. GOOSE'S ROOM - NIGHT
	
	The lights are out in Goose's room at the Bachelor Officers' 
	Quarters. The door opens, and Maverick enters. He sets a 
	cardboard box on the bed.
	
	Silently, Maverick gathers together Goose's few personal 
	possessions. He fills the box with clothes, books, a clock, a 
	radio, a walkman, and articles from the bathroom. He examines 
	each closely, like an artifact...as if he might find some 
	message or meaning in them. He fumbles them into the box. He 
	can't see too well, his eyes are full of tears.
	
	Maverick closes the box and carries it to the door. He takes 
	one last glance around, then leaves and closes the door 
	behind him.
	
	
	89A.  INT. BOQ RECEPTION AREA                      *
	
	Carol and the kid, stand, staring at a silent TV. Carol 
	looks dazed, lost. Maverick walks in, finds her. An awkward 
	silence while they both try to think of something to say. 
	Maverick hands the box to Carol.
	
	90.   OMITTED
	
	89B.  CLOSE UP - MAVERICK.
	
	He sits staring right through us...the thousand-yard stare. 
	A strange white unreal light washes over him. The only color, 
	the Navy and gold of the stripes on his shoulderboards. A low 
	rumbling mumbling filters through the HISS of surf or fans or 
	something...Snatches of low whispered 
	conversation....disregard of...basic air-safety 
	principles...too aggressive...incident.... 29 July...within 
	performance parameters... disciplinary action...tactical 
	doctrine.... even reckless at times... 
	conjecture...unsupported ...benefit of the doubt...
	
	Maverick's 
	eyes slowly focus. The light attenuates. The surrounding 
	image becomes denser. Things become real.
	
	
	89C.  INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - MAVERICK'S POV
	
	A BOARD OF INQUIRY, a COMMANDER and other NAVY OFFICERS 
	seated behind tables at the front of the room. Maverick faces 
	them, wearing dress whites. Viper is also present. The 
	Commander looks at each of the Officers. They each nod, in 
	turn, indicating readiness. The Commander turns to Maverick, 
	and states for the record:
	
			CDR.
	The Board of Inquiry finds that Lt. 
	Evan Mitchell was not at fault in 
	the accident of twenty-nine July.
	
	No response from Maverick, one way or the other. Viper 
	studies his face with concern.
	
			CDR.
	 Lt. Mitchell's record will be 
	cleared of this incident.
	
	
	Still no response from Maverick.
	
		CDR.
	Lt. Mitchell is restored to flight 
	status without further delay. These 
	proceedings are closed.
	
	Maverick doesn't respond.
	
	
	91.  INT. MAVERICK'S ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Maverick lies on his bunk and stares at the ceiling. The 
	phone next to his bed is RINGING.  It RINGS EIGHT OR NINE 
	TIMES, then stops. He makes no move to reach for it. 
	
	
	92. through 95. OMITTED
	
	
	94A.  INT. COCKPIT - F-14 ON FLIGHT LINE
	
	Maverick sits in the cockpit staring at the controls while 
	the ground crew preps the aircraft for flight. Coogan helps 
	him strap in. He speaks solicitously to Maverick. It is 
	unheard over the JET NOISE and RADIO BABBLE. Maverick looks 
	at the cockpit as if it's a strange territory, suddenly 
	foreign to him. He grabs the stick like it's some peculiar 
	talisman. He turns and looks aft. He seems surprised that it 
	moves the control surfaces in the tails.
	
	96.  INT. F-14 - DAY
	
			FUNGUS
	BOGEY AT TEN O'CLOCK LOW. YOU'VE 
	GOT THE ANGLE -- PIECE OF CAKE.
	
	
	Maverick checks ten o'clock low. He is disturbed. He tries 
	to make the move, but he is a man with no secret: he is 
	afraid.
	
			FUNGUS
	ENGAGE, MAVERICK - ANYTIME.
	
	
	The bogey abruptly turns into him. Maverick hesitates. Then 
	suddenly, he jerks the stick hard right and takes the F-14 
	away from the bogey at great speed. Fungus is startled.
	
			FUNGUS
	WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN 
	THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
	
		MAVERICK
	DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
	
			FUNGUS
	WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO 
	LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
	
			MAVERICK
	NO. NO GOOD.
	
	
	96A.  INT. FLIGHT LINE - DAY
	
	Jester walks up to Viper who waits near an F-5.
	
			JESTER
	He just won't engage. He can't do 
	it, Skipper. He can't get back on 
	the horse. 
	
			VIPER
	It's only been a week. Keep sending 
	him up.
	
			JESTER
	I've seen this before.
	
			VIPER
	So have I.
	
			JESTER
	Some guys never get it back.
	
	
	He walks off.
	
	
	
	97. through 102.  OMITTED
	
	
	103.  INT. LOCKER ROOM - IMMEDIATELY AFTER 
	
	Maverick grabs his stuff out of the locker, throws them in a 
	bag. He glances up as Fungus enters, continues to pack.
	
			FUNGUS
	What are you doing?
	
			MAVERICK
	Saving them some paperwork.
	
			FUNGUS
	Since when did you care about  
	paperwork? 
	
	Maverick walks away. Fungus hesitates, then follows him.
	
			FUNGUS
	If I could fly like you I'd have 
	everything I want. If I could fly 
	at all. I can't fly. I can't fly 
	like that. Nobody can. Whatever it 
	is, you've got it!
	
			MAVERICK
	Not anymore. 
	
			FUNGUS
	So, you're scared--so what? You 
	ever get a good look at me in the 
	back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
	
	Grabbing the suitcase, Maverick brushes past Jester and 
	walks up the corridor. Jester and Fungus watch him go. Fungus 
	goes to the phone.
	
	
	104.  EXT. SAN DIEGO AIRPORT - NIGHT
	
	Charlie parks her car, jumps out, and runs toward the main 
	entrance to the terminal.
	
	
	105.  INT. TERMINAL
	
	Charlie hurries through the crowd, bumping past people, 
	searching frantically for Maverick in the huge terminal. She 
	moves past bench after bench, and her eyes flick in all 
	directions. A quick glance at the souvenir shop, the coffee 
	shop, and then she heads for the bar.
	
	Maverick is there, sitting alone in a booth with his 
	suitcase beside him, staring into a drink. Charlie composes 
	herself, then walks to the booth and sits down across the 
	table from him. Maverick does not look pleased.
	
			CHARLIE
	Never liked fighter pilots anyway. 
	
	
	
	He looks up trying to be angry, but he can't help it, she 
	makes him laugh.
	
			MAVERICK
	You came to the right place.
	
	The waitress comes up.
	
			MAVERICKWhat are you having?
	
	Turns to the waitress.
	
			CHARLIE
	I'll have what he's having... 
	Hemlock, is it?
	
	The waitress departs. He tries not to smile, but can't help 
	it.
	
			CHARLIE
	You weren't gonna say goodbye?
	
			MAVERICK
	I was, later. 
	
			CHARLIE
	Long distance? I wouldn't do that 
	to you. I'd at least talk to you.
	
			MAVERICK
	I didn't want to see you. I mean, I 
	did...but I didn't..
	
			CHARLIE
	I know exactly what you mean.
	
			MAVERICK
	How could you?
	
		CHARLIE
	I've got a gift just like you do. 
	My gift is I just know what people 
	mean, even if they can't say it. It 
	helps when you're trying to 
	communicate with fighter pilots. 
	Like what you just said was "I'm 
	embarrassed, I feel I've done 
	something wrong, that I've failed, 
	and I don't think I can live up to 
	the expectations of a wonderful 
	interesting, intelligent woman like 
	yourself." That about it?
	
			MAVERICK
	    (laughs)
	...Something like that.
	
	
			CHARLIE
	And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by 
	myself for awhile, like until I can 
	think of a new career...hotel 
	management or something...
	
			MAVERICK
	Big talk for someone who's never 
	been shot off her computer.
	
			CHARLIE
	Hey, I never said I was a fighter 
	pilot...I never claimed to think it 
	was fun to be shot off the end of a 
	ship in a storm. I can find 
	contentment in a good book. I don't 
	have to roar by someone at Mach two 
	with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I 
	just get happy being with the right 
	man.
	
			MAVERICK
	I hope you find him.
	
			CHARLIE
	I think I have... I could be wrong. 
	I have been before. Just remember 
	one thing. If you're not Top Gun, 
	if you're not fighting jets, you're 
	not gonna be able to act like a 
	fighter pilot... You're gonna have 
	to act like the rest of us. You're 
	gonna have to master humility. For 
	you guys, that's the toughest 
	maneuver of all.
	
	She gets up...lays a bill out for the drinks...
	
			CHARLIE
	So long, Sailor. See you on the 
	beach sometime.
	
	
	She swings away. Her wake sucks in the stares of every man 
	in the place. Then they look over to Maverick, quick flicks 
	of envy in their eyes. He stares them back and can't quite 
	meet their eyes.
	
	
	106.  EXT. BEACH AT VIPER'S HOUSE - LATER
	
	Viper is tugged down the beach by a three year old kid. They 
	come across one creature who's had a bad night...Viper spots 
	him, he spots Viper, and Viper moves toward him. Tim, Viper's 
	kid, wants to head for the sea and pulls his father in that 
	direction. He stops, puts his hand on his hips like he's seen 
	the pilots do. 
	
			TIM
	Dad...Of all the aminals in the 
	ocean, which one's the baddest?
	
	
			VIPER
	I don't know, Tim. You'll have to 
	ask them.
	
	Viper turns to the creature, Maverick, and shrugs.
	
			VIPER
	Runs in the family...
	
	Maverick stands up. 
	
			MAVERICK
	Skipper, sorry to bother you.
	
			VIPER
	No bother.
	
			MAVERICK
	I called your house.
	
			VIPER
	My wife's house.
	
			MAVERICK
	She said you took your kid to the  
	each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or 
	beach or the ballgame. Y'have the 
	option...(Maverick thinks for a 
	beat. Segues to the question...) 
	What about me?
	
	Viper turns, they stroll together.
	
			VIPER
	We can send you back to your 
	squadron with nothing noted on your 
	record except "CNC" --course not 
	completed, no explanation required. 
	Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your 
	career, but people always wonder 
	about things like that.
	
			MAVERICK
	Or....
	
			VIPER
	Or you can quit.
	
			MAVERICK
		I don't know...
	 
			VIPER
	I didn't know either. That's why I 
	told Jester to prepare your papers.
	
	Maverick looks irritated. Viper stops at an icecream vendor 
	and orders three with a gesture.
	
			MAVERICK
	You've already made up your mind.
	
	
			VIPER
	It's no disgrace, kid. That spin 
	was hell. It would wreck anyone's 
	confidence. You could be a good 
	pilot again someday...
	
			MAVERICK
	    (starts to get his back up)
	You think I should quit?!
	
			VIPER
	I didn't say that. That's up to 
	you. But I have responsibility for 
	the other guys up there, not just 
	you. They need to know you're all 
	right...that they can depend on 
	you.
	
	
	The vendor hands them icecream, they take it.
	
			MAVERICK
	Here, let me get this. We'll be 
	even.
	
	He reaches into his pocket for change, comes out with a 
	handful. Slams it on the counter, stars picking the proper 
	change out. Viper spots something and reaches for 
	it...Maverick sees and tries to block it, but Viper comes up 
	with the Navy Cross.
	
			MAVERICK
	Lucky charm.
	
	But Viper recognizes it for what it is.
	
			VIPER
	Sometimes it's luck, but in this 
	case, he earned it... I served with 
	your old man.
	
			MAVERICK
	I know.
	
			VIPER
	VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me 
	of him. You're just like he was, 
	only better...and worse.
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm nothing like him.
	
			VIPER
	You may not think so, but you are.
	
			MAVERICK
	He was by the book, all the way.
	
			VIPER
	They waved him off. He thought he 
	knew better. He hit the 
	ramp.
	
			MAVERICK
	I never heard that.
	
			VIPER
	Not something they tell dependents.
	
			MAVERICK
	It's not true.
	
	
	Viper looks at him, for a long beat, throws his icecream 
	away.
	
			VIPER
	Why would I lie?
	
	He turns, walks away. Maverick stands there for a moment, 
	thinking, then catches up to him, stops him...struggles with 
	the thought...as Viper breaks in...
	            
			VIPER
	You start on a wrong heading... the 
	more you stick to it, the further 
	you get from your target. A good 
	pilot always questions himself, 
	always questions his judgments, 
	stays alert for drift and makes the 
	corrections...You may find a little 
	discipline helps with the fear. You 
	don't have to be alone up there.
	
	A pause...quiet intensity.
	
			MAVERICK
	How can I go on? I feel so... 
	responsible.
	
			VIPER
	Kid, the plain fact is...you are. 
	I'm not gonna stand here and blow 
	sunshine up your ass. Technically, 
	they absolved you. You and I know 
	what really happened. You pushed 
	it. You are responsible and you'll 
	always carry that. You know what, 
	I'll carry it too. I should have 
	taken you out of that cockpit.
	I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... 
	I always try to find something 
	worthwhile in someone's death. It's 
	no trade-off. It's not one for one. 
	What you learned isn't worth his 
	death. It couldn't be. But maybe 
	there is some value in it. I know 
	it's the first thing I've ever seen 
	that's really gotten to you. Now 
	the question is, what will you do 
	with it. If it gets you out of 
	flight status...so you don't kill 
	yourself or anybody else...that's 
	good. That's one good thing. You 
	were an accident waiting to 
	happen.
	
			MAVERICK
	You think I shouldn't fly.
	
			VIPER
	I didn't say that. That's up to 
	you. I think that if you do, if you 
	choose to come back, you'll be a 
	better pilot... a better man.
	
			MAVERICK
	Would you take me back? Would they?
	
			VIPER
	I'll have to think about it. I 
	don't know about them. I do know 
	one thing, We've got a lot invested 
	in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even 
	more than those other guys, Naval 
	Aviation needs a very few, very 
	good men.
	
	107 through  114.  OMITTED
	
	
	115.  INT. TOP GUN OFFICE  
	
	LOUD ROCK AND ROLL. The graduation ceremonies are in full 
	swing...They consist of informal ribbing, laughing, and a lot 
	of talking with the hands. every now and then, the name Goose 
	comes up and a shadow passes across a face. For the most 
	part, they press on, having a good time. Fungus shrugs at 
	someone's question and looks around.
	
			FUNGUS
	I don't know where he is...
	
			PORK
	What are his plans?
	
			FUNGUS
	I don't know.
	
	Ice stands proudly holding the Top Gun plaque as others 
	congratulate him...Hollywood looks up as the door opens, 
	Maverick is there.  He looks uncomfortable, unsure. He sees 
	Ice with the plaque. Fungus moves over to him, brings him in.
			FUNGUS
	I'm glad.
	
			WOLFMAN
	Good to see you, man.
	
	One by one, they come over, shake his hand. Viper stands 
	there, looking pleased but gruff. Maverick walks over, shakes 
	his hand. The party starts to pick up. A real celebration, 
	now. 
	
	Jester enters, a sheaf of messages in his hand. He takes 
	Viper aside for a word. Viper nods at him. The group's 
	attention gradually swings onto them. They quiet down 
	instinctively. Viper finally turns to them.
	
			VIPER
	Gentlemen, you know how I hate to 
	break up this party before it has a 
	chance to get really out of hand...
	    (more serious)
	...but there's a major flap on.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	We're being called back?
	
			VIPER
	You're on your way. Don't bother 
	going to BOQ. Your bags are packed.
	
	He hands them orders. Someone turns the music back up... as 
	they shake hands all around, the music grows, becomes purer 
	as the background voices drop out. 
	
	115A.  TIGHT ON MAVERICK'S 
	EYES
	
	WIDEN OUT -
	
	To include his helmet. Stereo headphones from his walkman 
	carry the same music from the party as he sits in the cockpit 
	and stares at the grey water rushing under. He sits in his 
	Tomcat on Ready 5 Alert. In the back, Fungus plays a hand 
	computer game - Jet Attack.
	
	
	116.  EXT. USS KITTY HAWK - SOMEWHERE AT SEA
	
	Maverick's Tomcat sits waiting for a launch order on the 
	forward catapult.
	
	
	116A.  ANGLE - MAVERICK
	
	He goes over the briefing in his mind...Stinger's voice 
	breaks through the music.:
	
			STINGER (V.O.)
	...Navy oceanographic ship... 
	international waters... fired 
	upon... unknown forces...
	
	
	117.  INT. READY ROOM - USS KITTYHAWK - MOMENTS BEFORE
	
	In full flight gear, sixteen teams of fighter pilots and 
	RIO's pay close attention to the Squadron CO, Stinger.
	
			STINGER
	...by unknown forces...by Migs. We 
	don't know who they are.  All I 
	know is that it's our ship, and our 
	orders are to escort it out of the 
	area.
	
	Stinger circles an area on the map.
	
	
	117A.  TOMCAT ON THE DECK - MAVERICK
	
	He studies his copy of the same map, headings and vectors 
	pencilled in.
	
			STINGER (V.O.) 
	This is "Bullseye". A rescue 
	operation is to begin within the 
	hour. Your mission is to give air 
	support to that rescue. There are 
	MiGs in the area, and tensions are 
	high. If you witness a hostile act 
	you will return fire. We will be 
	covering 360 degrees of the compass 
	by section. Be prepared for 
	anything.
	
	117B.  INT. READY ROOM 
	
	Stinger is speaking to individual pilots.
	
			SLIDER
	Ice and Hollywood, sector two.
	
	He turns to Maverick who stands nearby.
	
			SLIDER
	And Maverick. You'll back them up, 
	on Ready Five.
	
	
	117C.  CLOSE ON HIS FACE
	
	A moment's disappointment passes so fleetingly, you hardly 
	see it.
	
			MAVERICK
	Yessir.
	
	As the aircrews file out, tense but excited.
	
	
	118.  ICE AND HOLLYWOOD FLY TOGETHER AT TEN THOUSAND FEET 
	
	Their eyes search the horizon, while Slider and Wolfman 
	watch their instruments. 
	
			ICE
	MUSTANG, THIS IS VOODOO ONE,
		WE ARE ON STATION.
	
	The two jets streak across the sky.
	
	
	118A.  INT. COCKPIT
	
	Suddenly, there are BLIPS on the radar scope.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	CONTACT. TWO BOGEYS 20 RIGHT. AT 12 
	MILES, CLOSING.
	
	
	118B.  INT. COCKPIT - THEIR POV
	
	Two MiGs flying low to the deck.

	TALLY HO. TWO MIGS AT TWO

	118C.  THE MIGS SUDDENLY PULL VERTICAL, STREAK STRAIGHT UP. 
	
	
	118D.  ICE AND HOLLYWOOD WATCH CAREFULLY.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS, 
	BOYS?
	
			ICE
	THEY'RE JUST HASSELING. LET'S WORK 
	THEM OUT OF THE AREA.
	
			WOLFMAN
	I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN 
	AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	GOT 'EM.
	
	
	118E.  THE FOUR MIGS
	
	Join together in a box formation, begin to circle the area.
	
			HOLLYWOOD
	TWO MORE -- TWO MORE CONTACTS. 
	2-7-0 at 10 MILES. WE NEED SOME 
	HELP HERE, MUSTANG.
	
			ICE
	MUSTANG, WE HAVE FOUR MIGS IN THE 
	AREA OF BULLSEYE. REQUEST YOU 
	LAUNCH THE ALERT 5 FOR SUPPORT.
	
	
	119.  DECK - KITTY HAWK 
	
	Maverick sits in his Tomcat on the Catapult on ready alert, 
	listening to the message traffic. He gets a launch order, 
	turns to the LSO. The LSO salutes, Maverick salutes and flips 
	him the bird. The LSO drops to the deck. Maverick is slammed 
	back as the F-14 is fired off the deck and rockets into the 
	sky.
	
			CCA (V.O. filtered)
	ROGER, VOODOO.
	
	
	120.  EXT. SKY - HOLLYWOOD AND ICE 
	
	The two MiGs cross in a scissor pattern in their path... a  
	provocation...they join together again and fly level at ten 
	thousand feet. One of the MiGs does a sudden canopy roll.
	
			HOLLYWOOD 
	VERY FANCY!
	
	BOOM! A FLASH! Suddenly, Out of nowhere, Hollywood's hit.  
	WHAM! Just that fast, he's hit and goes down.  His f-14 
	disappears into the clouds.
	
			ICE
	WOOD! WOOD, ACKNOWLEDGE!
	
	Ice puts his nose down and follows him.
	
			ICE
	VOODOO ONE, MUSTANG. VOODOO THREE 
	IS HIT. GOING DOWN. WILL ATTEMPT 
	SAR.
	
	
	He comes out of clouds at 1500, nothing but empty water 
	below.
			ICE
	Do you have them? Did they get out 
	or not?
	
			SLIDER
	    (confusion)
	No contact. I don't know.  
	
	
	121.  EXT. MAVERICK'S F-14
	
			MAVERICK
	VOODOO, GHOST RIDER ONE. I'M ON THE 
	WAY. WAIT FOR ME.
	
	
	122.  THE SKY - MIGS AND TOMCATS CIRCLE
	
			SLIDER
	THEY GOT WOLF, THEY GOT WOOD. THEY 
	GOT THEM..  
	
			ICE
	MUSTANG, GHOST RIDER. PERMISSION TO 
	FIRE.
	
			STRIKE (V.O.) 
	GHOST RIDER,  THIS IS MUSTANG. 
	PERMISSION TO FIRE. PERMISSION TO

			ICE
	ROGER. ENGAGING. I HAVE THE LEAD.
	
	
	122A.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14
	
			FUNGUS
	Let's go! Dive on those bastards!  
	
	Maverick hesitates.
	
			FUNGUS
	Come on, man, engage. This is it. 
	Get your nose in there.
	
	Maverick hesitates again. He sees the hornet's nest below; 
	planes all over the sky.
	
			FUNGUS
	Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. 
	Take him. Pull on the goddamn 
	stick, man!
	
			MAVERICK
	Okay, okay.
	
			FUNGUS
	Don't tell me okay. Do it!
	
	Maverick draws a breath, then forces himself to pull the 
	stick over. The F-14 rolls in hard toward the battle. 
	Suddenly, the cluster breaks apart. The MiGs break in every 
	direction as Maverick BLASTS through their formation. 
	Something comes up through the clouds. A MiG BLASTS by. 
	Another rolls in and locks onto them.
	
	The MiGs swarm toward the TOMCATS, coming from every 
	direction. CANNON FIRE erupts from one of the MiGs.
	
			MAVERICK
	MAVERICK'S EMGAGED. HARD LEFT, ICE, 
	PADLOCK THE EASTERN SECTION.
	
	The F-14's execute a left oblique turn in unison. They come 
	down in a section attack with their cannons blazing. From 
	Maverick's cockpit, everything looks choppy:  MiGs slide past 
	at incredible speed. Cannons BLAST, as the planes scramble 
	for position.
	
	Out-numbered four to two, Maverick and Ice fight 
	defensively. Maverick has the angle on a MIG, when Fungus 
	spots a missile launch.
	
			FUNGUS
	BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! 
	FLARES!
	
			MAVERICK
	BREAKING LEFT!
	
	Maverick releases a flare as he takes the F-14 into a hard 
	left. The missile tracks the heat of the flare and sails out 
	of the area, missing the Tomcat and falling toward the sea.
	
			ICE
	TWO MIGS ON MY TAIL, MAVERICK. I'M 
	DEFENSIVE.
	
	Maverick jerks his stick right and streaks toward Ice. He 
	cuts off one of the MiGs with CANNON FIRE, driving it down 
	toward the deck. Ice goes into vertical and comes around to 
	gain an angle on the other MiG. His RIO is in position to 
	check Mav's rear. 
	
			SLIDER
	MAVERICK! SIX O'CLOCK!
	
	Maverick turns to look and jerks a hard left. The MiG is on 
	him, CANNON BLAZING. Ice Yo Yos inside and cuts the MiG off. 
			ICE
	FOX ONE.
	
	He fires a sidewinder. The MiG turns hard, the missile sails 
	away.
	
	
			SLIDER
	BANDIT, THREE O'OLOCK HIGH!
	
	Ice's F-14 is suddenly caught in a HAIL OF CANNON FIRE as a 
	MiG sweeps down from three o'clock. He breaks, dives. The 
	jets streak across the sky, low to the deck, skimming the 
	surface.
	
			FUNGUS
	ICE'S  DEFENSIVE, HELP HIM OUT.
	
	Maverick's F-14 Rollaways in and intercepts the bogey on 
	Ice's tail.
	
			MAVERICK
	REVERSE RIGHT.
	
	Ice turns right, the MiG bugs and jerks into vertical.  
	Maverick swoops after him.
	
			FUNGUS
	STAY WITH HIM. YOUR SIX IS CLEAR.
	
	
	Maverick closes, jerking left, right, twisting and turning, 
	staying on his tail. 
	
	
	122B.  MAVERICK'S COCKPIT
	
			FUNGUS
	ONE ON OUR SIX! BUG OUT! BUG OUT!
	
	BULLETS fly by Maverick's F-14 from the MiG on his six. He 
	pulls a hard left, then takes the plane straight up. We hear 
	instructions shouted by Fungus, but it is all obscured in the 
	SOUNDS AND FURY OF THE BATTLE. Maverick peels over the top 
	and comes down like a comet. A series of passes at the MiGs. 
	As they come by, one of the MiGs pulls up, 
	
			MAVERICK
	OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH. 
	
			ICE
	LOOK OUT! 
	
	
	They look up. An MiG 21 is coming down, belly to them, close 
	to a mid-air collision.
	
			MAVERICK
	JESUS!
	
	
	He pushes down. The MiG ROARS BY. The whole airplane goes 
	"BOOOMMMM" it's that close.
	
			FUNGUS
	OHHHHH SHIT!
	
	The shock, the air pressure SLAMS them as it goes by, 
	missing by 4-5 feet. Maverick pulls back in, sees a MiG 21 
	below. It takes off, bugging out. Ice goes after him. The MiG 
	maneuvers, jerking hard left, hard right, twisting  up, down.
	
	Ice is right in his shadow. They come in hard and low over 
	the sea. He has the MiG in the diamond.
	
			ICE
	GOOD TONE, FOX ONE
	
	The MiG starts turning.
	
			ICE
	Ah Nuts!
	
	
	The missile goes by the tail.
	
			ICE
	Son of a bitch!
	
	Then his tail comes off, the airplane goes over, a chute 
	comes out. The MiG EXPLODES into a thousand small pieces. 
	They roar by the MiG pilot hanging in his straps.
	
			SLIDER
	JESUS!  HEY SPLASH ONE, SPLASH ONE 
	BANDIT! SPLASH THAT SUCKER!
	
			MAVERICK
	I GOT ONE HERE. ON THE NOSE.  
	COMING DOWN. 
	
	Rolling down on him, good SIDEWINDER TONE. The MiG'S sense 
	him, they break, one guy down low. 
	
			ICE
	ON THE NOSE?
	
			MAVERICK
	GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
	 
	He squeezes the trigger.
	
	
	123.  EXT. THE MISSILE STARTS TO GO 
	
	The vapor trail comes off, the MiG 21 turns like he's been 
	bounced off a rubber wall, comes around on the missile, beats 
	it. The missile flies by him. 
	
	
			MAVERICK
	AH, SHIT! GODDAMN IT!
	
	MiG comes back turning into him.
	
			FUNGUS
	THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
	
			MAVERICK
	I GOT ONE COMING UP.
	
			FUNGUS
	AND HE'S GUNNING.
	
	He looks back. 30 millimeter tracers go by; they just kind 
	of float. He breaks, hits airbrakes, the trailing MiG dives 
	through.
	
	Suddenly another MiG appears, rocketing straight for him. 
	They close at 900 knots--VABOOOM!--They pass nose to nose, 
	canopy to canopy. Both planes pitch straight up, trying for 
	the altitude advantage.
	
			MAVERICK
	Zone 5 burners.
	
	The F-14 outclimbs the MiG sitting on its tail, full 
	thruster, it rockets straight up, away from the planet.  
	Maverick has the advantage. Suddenly, his F-14 runs out of 
	energy. FUNGUS is the first to call it.
	
			FUNGUS
	We're ballistic! Ohhhhhh Shit!
	
	The plane backs down on itself, backs into its own smoke as 
	it flips over, falls away...He catches it, just regains 
	control, when...A ROAR. He looks up.
	
	SECOND MIG coming down. Right on him. It fills the Canopy! 
	Instinctive - A Push to miss him, Maverick breaks fast down 
	into him, a last ditch maneuver, and the airplane 
	DEPARTS...the roll rates and the pitch rates combine and it 
	tumbles over the top; the airplane just goes end-over-end. 
	They are being slammed and rattled all over the 
	cockpits...bone-jarring, neck-snapping whips. SHRIEKS and 
	SCREAMS from the airframe. Terriflying?
	
			FUNGUS
	Ohhh Mother!
	
			MAVERICK
	    (strangely calm)
	Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a 
	slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, 
	I've got it.
	
	
	Fungus is getting his teeth rattled. He's helpless, he has 
	no controls, there's nothing he can do but hold on.
	
	
			FUNGUS
	Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? 
	Are you CRAZY?
	
			MAVERICK
	Roger, I've got it. 
	
	The plane's gyrations are rattling Fungus's helmet off the 
	canopy. 
	
			FUNGUS
	You've got it?   Good!  Cause for a 
	minute there, you had me worried.
	
	It yaws and rolls, starts into a spin.
	
			FUNGUS
	Now have you got it?  Have you 
	still got it?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yawing right.
	
			FUNGUS
	I know!
	
			MAVERICK
	Rudder's left, stick's forward.
	
			FUNGUS
	Swell! Passing ten thousand!
	
	
			MAVERICK
	I've got it -- hold on!
	
			FUNGUS
	Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your 
	harness!
	
			MAVERICK
	I can recover. Hold on!
	
	They're in a progressive spiral, nose low.  The altimeter 
	unwinds, speed picks up. The G forces are forcing them away 
	from the axis of spin, jamming Maverick against the 
	instrument panel at the front of the cockpit. 
	
			MAVERICK
	You with me?
	
	Fungus, also, is jammed to his panel.
	
			FUNGUS
	Right behind you. 
	
	He is closer to the center of spin and less strongly held. 
	It doesn't do much good, however, he can't control the plane. 
	The only thing he can reach is the yellow and black loop; the 
	ejection handle. He reaches for it.
	
			FUNGUS
	Speed's up to 150. 
	
	Fungus's eyes are wide.  The earth grows larger as it rises 
	towards them. G forces flatten them. They've long since lost 
	the MiG. Nobody but an idiot would try to follow them in this 
	maneuver.
	
			FUNGUS
	5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
	
			MAVERICK
	Okay.
	
	
	The earth grows larger.
	
			FUNGUS
	4500. Critical point.
	
	
	FUNGUS grabs the ejection handle with both hands.
	
			MAVERICK
	No! Not again!
	
			FUNGUS
	What are you talking about,
		we gotta go!
	
			MAVERICK
	I'm not losing it again!
	
	The jet is standing on its nose, gaining speed, plunging 
	towards the ocean.  
	
			FUNGUS
	Gotta go, man.
	
			MAVERICK
	280, 290, 300 knots.
	
			FUNGUS
	3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man.  
	3,000 feet, we gotta go!
	
			MAVERICK
	You go. I'm staying with it.
	
			FUNGUS
	I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
	
	Then, just as suddenly, as he's about to pull...Maverick 
	catches it. The plane responds. They're out of the spin. He 
	gets control. Fungus sits there dumbly, hands on handle. 
	Still not believing...
	
			FUNGUS
	ONE....ONE....ONE...
	
	
	SEA LEVEL 
	
	Maverick stops the tumble, pulls the nose up quickly and the 
	F-l4 sweeps into level flight no more than a hundred feet 
	above the deck. He comes up and looks right at Ice. Ice is 
	down low. He comes around, a MiG-21 all over him like a cheap 
	suit. A flick, a whip, and Maverick in perfect position, 
	rolls right in on the MiG. Fungus looks like he just saw 
	Jesus. 
	
			FUNGUS
	What  in  the  Christ...was that? 
	
	He looks at the Mig target set-up in front of him in awe.
	
			FUNGUS
	Did you plan that? Was all that 
	something you planned?
	
	
	Maverick's acquired the target and is all business. 
	
			MAVERICK
	ALL RIGHT, ICE. COME HARD 
	STARBOARD, THEN EXTEND TO THE EAST. 
	
	
	Fungus is still lividly frazzled.
	
			FUNGUS
	Because...if that was... Next time 
	you tell me first.
	
			ICE
	ROG.
	
	Maverick breaks down, Ice zooms up, breaks in and takes the 
	MiG the other way. Maverick Yo Yo's in, comes right up behind 
	the MiG, as the MiG starts acceleration. 
	
	
	Maverick rolls in on Ice and the MiG. 
	
			MAVERICK
	I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD 
	TONE ON IT.
	
			ICE
	I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF  
	A SHOT?
	
			MAVERICK
	I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
	
			ICE
	WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
	
			MAVERICK
	WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2 
	
	The MiG fires.
	
			MAVERICK
	HE FIRED, BREAK NOW!
	
	Ice breaks left, drops flares. The MiG's missile follows the 
	flares. Maverick FIRES. The missile doesn't twitch. It flys 
	right up the tail pipe of the MiG, the canopy flies off, the 
	pilot comes out of it, and then the MiG blows up, We go right 
	through the fire ball. VVVARRRUOOMMM!
	
			MAVERICK
	He's out! We got him!
	
	The MiG rolls into the ground...KABOOM!  They swoop by the 
	pilot, hanging in his straps...He watches them, dumbly. 
	Fungus waves. 
	
			FUNGUS
	What a dope! Maybe they'll
		give him another plane...and we
		can shoot him down again.
	
	Maverick and Ice join up, light it, stand on their burners 
	and blast straight for the sun.
	
	
	MAVERICK'S F-14 
	
	Without warning, a triple roll, as the elation hits him.
	
	
	125.  INT. MAVERICK'S COCKPIT 
	
			FUNGUS
	What is it? What's wrong?
	
	
	Fungus nervously looks around at his circuit breakers.
	
			FUNGUS
	Is there something I should know?
	
			MAVERICK
	Just relax.
	
			FUNGUS
	Is it the plane?
	
			MAVERICK
	The plane is fine.
	
			FUNGUS
	Is it you?
	
			MAVERICK
	Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We 
	did it...Damn! We sure did it!
	
			MAVERICK
	HELLO MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK. 
	I'VE GOT A MESSAGE FOR STINGER. 
	
			STRIKE 
	(V.O.) 
	ROGER, MAVERICK. GO AHEAD.
	
			MAVERICK
	TELL STINGER MAVERICK HAS GOOD NEWS 
	AND SOME BAD NEWS. THE GOOD NEWS IS 
	THAT ICE GOT A MIG. THE BAD NEWS IS 
	THAT MAVERICK GOT TWO!
	
	He looks over at Ice.  
	
			MAVERICK
	I GOTTA HAVE ONE.
	
	
	126.  INT. ICE'S COCKPIT
	
			SLIDER
	We're low on fuel, Ice.
	
	Ice considers for a moment, then responds.
	
			ICE
	I know. I know....Aw hell, let's do 
	it!
	
	
	127.  INT. MAVERICK'S COCKPIT
	
			FUNGUS
	You're not supposed to...
	
			MAVERICK
	But I have to!
	
			FUNGUS
	Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right 
	behind you.
	
			MAVERICK
	MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST 
	A FLYBY.
	
	
	128.  PRI-FLY BRIDGE - (Primary Flight Control)  USS KITTY 
	HAWK
	
	The Air Boss speaks to Maverick over the UHF. The Admiral, 
	the XO and other officers watch and listen.
	
			AIR BOSS
	NEGATIVE, GHOST RIDER, THE 
	PATTERN'S FULL.
	
			MAVERICK (V.O. filtered)
	MUSTANG, THIS IS GHOST RIDER. 
	REQUEST A FLYBY FOR TWO.
	
			OFFICER
	Who is that guy?
	
	
			ADMIRAL
	Mitchell...
	
			XO
	   (surpressing a grin)
	...Likes to break at 600, 'stead of 
	300 knots. The Air Boss hates him. 
	One time, he came over the deck at 
	two hundred, shakes the shit out of 
	the bridge. Lifted Johnson right 
	off his feet.
	
	
	129.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14
	
	He glances over at Ice, who gives him thumbs up.
	
			MAVERICK
	BOSS, YOU BETTER CLEAR IT OUT,
		WE'RE FIVE MINUTES OUT
		AND WE'RE DOING IT!
	
	
	130.  INT. PRI-FLY BRIDGE
	
	The Admiral looks out over the water and smiles.
	
			MAVERICK (V.O. filtered)
	TEN MILES ASTERN, BOSS. HOW ABOUT 
	IT?
	
	
	The Air Boss is livid. He clenches the mike.
	
			AIR BOSS
	MUSTANG TO GHOST RIDER!...
	
	Just then the Admiral pipes up.
	
			ADMIRAL
	Johnson!
	
			AIR BOSS
	Yes, Sir, Admiral?
	
			ADMIRAL
	Give him his flyby.
	
	
	The Admiral looks at the others, tries to surpress his own 
	grin. He slides into his (borrowed) command chair, looks into 
	the wind. On the back of the chair, a clue; his name and 
	rank:  RADM. Buford Clancy, "BOOMER"
	
	The AIR BOSS burns, but has no choice. 
	
			AIR BOSS
	    (really pissed off)
	 ROGER, GHOST RIDER, YOU'RE CLEAR.
	
	131.  EXT. 
	KITTY HAWK DAY
	
	Sailors line the deck and search the sky. They crane their 
	necks from their battle stations, sweating into the sun, 
	watching for the approach of F-14's. Someone sees it--he 
	points and SHOUTS. The F-14 appears, and every man stands and 
	CHEERS.
	
	
	132. POV -
	
	WE COME SCREAMING IN, 5 FEET OVER THE WATER, throwing up 
	rooster tails behind. WE SPLIT OFF and ZOOM along each side 
	of the carrier, at 100 feet and ROLL IT.
	
	
	133.  INT. PRI-FLY BRIDGE--VVVAAAAABBOOOOM!
	
	It lifts the Air Boss right off his feet. The walls warp, 
	dust sifts from the overhead. The whole tower just goes BOOM!
	
			AIR BOSS
	Goddamn that guy!"
	
	
	134.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
	
	They break at 500 knots. Ice is first down over the ramp, 
	waved in.  The F-14 comes in a little rocky. It bounces hard 
	but grabs the wire, then jerks to a sudden halt. The sailors 
	CHEER AND APPLAUD, throwing fists of victory into the air, 
	straining to get a look at Ice as the crew directs his plane 
	off to the side. Opening the canopy, Ice and Slider unstrap. 
	Stinger and the others are there. Guys are climbing up, 
	climbing all over the airplane. They're already painting a 
	MiG on the side, and they're looking at Ice in awe.
	
	
	135.  POV - MAVERICK - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - AS HE LANDS
	
	He catches the wire, the view slams down toward the deck as 
	the plane arrests, then comes up...He releases the cockpit 
	and can hear the ROAR OF THE CROWD...
	
	
	136.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
	
	He swings the nose around past Ice's. Ice's plane is covered 
	in colored jerseys as the ground crew pulls him out. 
	Maverick's plane swings towards the PRI-FLY BRIDGE. Pilots in 
	flightsuits pour from the deck hatch APPLAUDING... 
	
	
	137.  HE CUTS HIS ENGINES AS THE GROUND CREW SWARMS
	
	As Maverick and Fungus climb down, they see their wingmen on 
	the deck. Ice is looking in Maverick's direction. His face is 
	inscrutable. Maverick gets mobbed, but pushes over to Ice. 
	They stare at each other for a moment, eye to eye even as 
	they are buffeted by the crowd. Finally, Ice breaks...a grin.
	
	
			ICE
	I guess I owe you one.
	
			MAVERICK
	You don't owe me anything.
		We're on the same team. 
	
			ICE
	You saved our lives. You did it! 
	
			MAVERICK
	We did it.
	
			ICE
	You're a hell of a flyer.
		    (he can't resist)
		You can be my wingman any time.
